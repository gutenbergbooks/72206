  <h2 class='c005'>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Of the essays in this volume some have already been published in <cite>Literary Remains</cite>,
<cite>Sketches and Essays</cite>, or <cite>Winterslow</cite> (see Bibliographical Note to Vol. <span class='fss'>XI</span>.), and the
rest (with one exception) are now reprinted for the first time. The exception is
‘The Sick Chamber’ which was published by Mr. Ireland in his <cite>William Hazlitt
Essayist and Critic, Selections from his Writings</cite>. Some of the essays now republished
for the first time have been attributed to Hazlitt by Mr. W. C. Hazlitt (<cite>Memoirs</cite>,
1867, 1. xxii-xxxii—Chronological Catalogue), or by Mr. Ireland (<cite>List of the
Writings of William Hazlitt and Leigh Hunt</cite>); others have not before been identified.
The Editors, however, have not included any essay as to Hazlitt’s authorship of
which any reasonable doubt can exist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reference may here be made to a few essays which, though they may have been
written by Hazlitt, have been excluded from the present volume, because the evidence
of their authorship was not sufficiently strong. They are arranged in the
following list under the heading of the Magazine in which they first appeared.</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>I.</dt>
    <dd>In <cite>The New Monthly Magazine</cite>.
    <dl class='dl_1'>
      <dt>1.</dt>
      <dd>Four papers entitled ‘The Confessional’ (1822, vol. <span class='fss'>IV.</span> pp. 349, 
      450; vol. v. pp. 54, 406) which read very much as if they were written by Hazlitt during 
      the <em>Liber Amoris</em> period.
      </dd>
      <dt>2.</dt>
      <dd>An essay entitled ‘Social Grievances’ (1822, vol. v. p. 412).
      </dd>
      <dt>3.</dt>
      <dd>An essay on ‘The Influence of Books on the Progress of Manners’ (May, 1828, vol. xxii. p. 
      409).
      </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
    <dt>II.</dt>
    <dd>In <cite>The Liberal</cite>.
    <dl class='dl_1'>
      <dt>1.</dt>
      <dd>In <cite>The Liberal</cite> (vol. 11. 1823) appeared an essay entitled ‘A Sunday’s Fête 
      at St. Cloud’ which was reprinted (without mention being made of its source) under the 
      title ‘A Fête at St. Cloud’ and attributed to Hazlitt in a volume of miscellanies called 
      ‘The Talisman; or Bouquet of Literature and the Fine Arts’ (1831), edited by Mrs. Alaric 
      A. Watts. The essay shows no trace of Hazlitt’s handiwork, and seems to have been written 
      ‘under a foreign sky,’ whereas Hazlitt did not start for his tour in France and Italy 
      till after the publication of the essay in <cite>The Liberal</cite>. An editorial 
      paragraph published in <em>The London Magazine</em> for October 1824, under the heading 
      of ‘The Lion’s Head,’ would seem to show that the writer of the sketch had sent it to 
      that magazine for publication. ‘<em>The Fête of St. Cloud</em>’ (the paragraph runs), 
      ‘though not unamusing, would not suit our pages. French subjects, <span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>as all Editors 
      and Kings can testify, are lively and dangerous. They are very irregular, or very poor.’ 
      The editor of <em>The London Magazine</em>, though he had at the time a grievance against 
      Hazlitt (see Vol. <span class='fss'>XI.</span> note to essay on ‘Peveril of the Peak’), 
      would hardly have spoken so patronisingly of one of his most distinguished contributors.

      <div class='line'>Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.’</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'><em>Where there’s a will, there’s a way.</em>—I said so to myself, as I
walked down Chancery-lane, about half-past six o’clock on Monday
the 10th of December, to inquire at Jack Randall’s where the fight
the next day was to be; and I found ‘the proverb’ nothing ‘musty’
in the present instance. I was determined to see this fight, come
what would, and see it I did, in great style. It was my <em>first fight</em>,
yet it more than answered my expectations. Ladies! it is to you I
dedicate this description; nor let it seem out of character for the fair
to notice the exploits of the brave. Courage and modesty are the old
English virtues; and may they never look cold and askance on one
another! Think, ye fairest of the fair, loveliest of the lovely kind,
ye practisers of soft enchantment, how many more ye kill with
poisoned baits than ever fell in the ring; and listen with subdued air
and without shuddering, to a tale tragic only in appearance, and
sacred to the <span class='sc'>Fancy</span>!</p>

<p class='c007'>I was going down Chancery-lane, thinking to ask at Jack Randall’s
where the fight was to be, when looking through the glass-door of
the <cite>Hole in the Wall</cite>, I heard a gentleman asking the same question
<em>at</em> Mrs. Randall, as the author of Waverley would express it. Now
Mrs. Randall stood answering the gentleman’s question, with the
authenticity of the lady of the Champion of the Light Weights.
Thinks I, I’ll wait till this person comes out, and learn from him
how it is. For to say a truth, I was not fond of going into this
house of call for heroes and philosophers, ever since the owner of it
(for Jack is no gentleman) threatened once upon a time to kick me
out of doors for wanting a mutton-chop at his hospitable board, when
the conqueror in thirteen battles was more full of <em>blue ruin</em> than of
good manners. I was the more mortified at this repulse, inasmuch
as I had heard Mr. James Simpkins, hosier in the Strand, one day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>when the character of the <cite>Hole in the Wall</cite> was brought in question,
observe—‘The house is a very good house, and the company quite
genteel: I have been there myself!’ Remembering this unkind
treatment of mine host, to which mine hostess was also a party, and
not wishing to put her in unquiet thoughts at a time jubilant like the
present, I waited at the door, when, who should issue forth but my
friend Jo. Toms, and turning suddenly up Chancery-lane with that
quick jerk and impatient stride which distinguishes a lover of the
<span class='sc'>Fancy</span>, I said, ‘I’ll be hanged if that fellow is not going to the fight,
and is on his way to get me to go with him.’ So it proved in effect,
and we agreed to adjourn to my lodgings to discuss measures with
that cordiality which makes old friends like new, and new friends
like old, on great occasions. We are cold to others only when we
are dull in ourselves, and have neither thoughts nor feelings to impart
to them. Give a man a topic in his head, a throb of pleasure in his
heart, and he will be glad to share it with the first person he meets.
Toms and I, though we seldom meet, were an <i><span lang="la">alter idem</span></i> on this
memorable occasion, and had not an idea that we did not candidly
impart; and ‘so carelessly did we fleet the time,’ that I wish no
better, when there is another fight, than to have him for a companion
on my journey down, and to return with my friend Jack
Pigott, talking of what was to happen or of what did happen, with a
noble subject always at hand, and liberty to digress to others whenever
they offered. Indeed, on my repeating the lines from Spenser
in an involuntary fit of enthusiasm,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What more felicity can fall to creature,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than to enjoy delight with liberty?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>my last-named ingenious friend stopped me by saying that this, translated
into the vulgate, meant ‘<em>Going to see a fight</em>.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Jo. Toms and I could not settle about the method of going down.
He said there was a caravan, he understood, to start from Tom
Belcher’s at two, which would go there <em>right out</em> and back again the
next day. Now I never travel all night, and said I should get a
cast to Newbury by one of the mails. Jo. swore the thing was
impossible, and I could only answer that I had made up my mind to
it. In short, he seemed to me to waver, said he only came to see if
I was going, had letters to write, a cause coming on the day after,
and faintly said at parting (for I was bent on setting out that moment)—‘Well,
we meet at Philippi!’ I made the best of my way to
Piccadilly. The mail-coach stand was bare. ‘They are all gone,’
said I—‘this is always the way with me—in the instant I lose the
future—if I had not stayed to pour out that last cup of tea, I should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>have been just in time’—and cursing my folly and ill-luck together,
without inquiring at the coach-office whether the mails were gone or
not, I walked on in despite, and to punish my own dilatoriness and
want of determination. At any rate, I would not turn back: I
might get to Hounslow, or perhaps farther, to be on my road the
next morning. I passed Hyde Park Corner (my Rubicon), and
trusted to fortune. Suddenly I heard the clattering of a Brentford
stage, and the fight rushed full upon my fancy. I argued (not
unwisely) that even a Brentford coachman was better company than
my own thoughts (such as they were just then), and at his invitation
mounted the box with him. I immediately stated my case to him—namely,
my quarrel with myself for missing the Bath or Bristol mail,
and my determination to get on in consequence as well as I could,
without any disparagement or insulting comparison between longer or
shorter stages. It is a maxim with me that stage-coaches, and consequently
stage-coachmen, are respectable in proportion to the distance
they have to travel: so I said nothing on that subject to my Brentford
friend. Any incipient tendency to an abstract proposition, or
(as he might have construed it) to a personal reflection of this kind,
was however nipped in the bud; for I had no sooner declared
indignantly that I had missed the mails, than he flatly denied that
they were gone along, and lo! at the instant three of them drove by
in rapid, provoking, orderly succession, as if they would devour the
ground before them. Here again I seemed in the contradictory
situation of the man in Dryden who exclaims,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I follow Fate, which does too hard pursue!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>If I had stopped to inquire at the White Horse Cellar, which would
not have taken me a minute, I should now have been driving down
the road in all the dignified unconcern and <em>ideal</em> perfection of
mechanical conveyance. The Bath mail I had set my mind upon,
and I had missed it, as I missed every thing else, by my own
absurdity, in putting the will for the deed, and aiming at ends without
employing means. ‘Sir,’ said he of the Brentford, ‘the Bath mail
will be up presently, my brother-in-law drives it, and I will engage
to stop him if there is a place empty.’ I almost doubted my good
genius; but, sure enough, up it drove like lightning, and stopped
directly at the call of the Brentford Jehu. I would not have believed
this possible, but the brother-in-law of a mail-coach driver is himself
no mean man. I was transferred without loss of time from the top
of one coach to that of the other, desired the guard to pay my fare
to the Brentford coachman for me as I had no change, was accommodated
with a great coat, put up my umbrella to keep off a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>drizzling mist, and we began to cut through the air like an arrow.
The milestones disappeared one after another, the rain kept off;
Tom Turtle, the trainer, sat before me on the coach-box, with whom
I exchanged civilities as a gentleman going to the fight; the passion
that had transported me an hour before was subdued to pensive
regret and conjectural musing on the next day’s battle; I was
promised a place inside at Reading, and upon the whole, I thought
myself a lucky fellow. Such is the force of imagination! On the
outside of any other coach on the 10th of December, with a Scotch
mist drizzling through the cloudy moonlight air, I should have been
cold, comfortless, impatient, and, no doubt, wet through; but seated
on the Royal mail, I felt warm and comfortable, the air did me good,
the ride did me good, I was pleased with the progress we had made,
and confident that all would go well through the journey. When I
got inside at Reading, I found Turtle and a stout valetudinarian,
whose costume bespoke him one of the <span class='sc'>Fancy</span>, and who had risen
from a three months’ sick bed to get into the mail to see the fight.
They were intimate, and we fell into a lively discourse. My friend
the trainer was confined in his topics to fighting dogs and men,
to bears and badgers; beyond this he was ‘quite chap-fallen,’ had
not a word to throw at a dog, or indeed very wisely fell asleep,
when any other game was started. The whole art of training (I,
however, learnt from him,) consists in two things, exercise and
abstinence, abstinence and exercise, repeated alternately and without
end. A yolk of an egg with a spoonful of rum in it is the first
thing in a morning, and then a walk of six miles till breakfast.
This meal consists of a plentiful supply of tea and toast and beef-steaks.
Then another six or seven miles till dinner-time, and
another supply of solid beef or mutton with a pint of porter, and
perhaps, at the utmost, a couple of glasses of sherry. Martin trains
on water, but this increases his infirmity on another very dangerous
side. The Gas-man takes now and then a chirping glass (under the
rose) to console him, during a six weeks’ probation, for the absence
of Mrs. Hickman—an agreeable woman, with (I understand) a
pretty fortune of two hundred pounds. How matter presses on me!
What stubborn things are facts! How inexhaustible is nature and
art! ‘It is well,’ as I once heard Mr. Richmond observe, ‘to
see a variety.’ He was speaking of cock-fighting as an edifying
spectacle. I cannot deny but that one learns more of what <em>is</em> (I do
not say of what <em>ought to be</em>) in this desultory mode of practical
study, than from reading the same book twice over, even though it
should be a moral treatise. Where was I? I was sitting at dinner
with the candidate for the honours of the ring, ‘where good digestion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>waits on appetite, and health on both.’ Then follows an hour of
social chat and native glee; and afterwards, to another breathing
over heathy hill or dale. Back to supper, and then to bed, and up
by six again—Our hero</p>

      <div class='line'>‘Follows so the ever-running sun</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>to the day that brings him victory or defeat in the green fairy circle.
Is not this life more sweet than mine? I was going to say; but I
will not libel any life by comparing it to mine, which is (at the
date of these presents) bitter as coloquintida and the dregs of
aconitum!</p>

<p class='c007'>The invalid in the Bath mail soared a pitch above the trainer, and
did not sleep so sound, because he had ‘more figures and more
fantasies.’ We talked the hours away merrily. He had faith in
surgery, for he had had three ribs set right, that had been broken
in a <em>turn-up</em> at Belcher’s, but thought physicians old women, for they
had no antidote in their catalogue for brandy. An indigestion is an
excellent common-place for two people that never met before. By
way of ingratiating myself, I told him the story of my doctor, who,
on my earnestly representing to him that I thought his regimen had
done me harm, assured me that the whole pharmacopœia contained
nothing comparable to the prescription he had given me; and, as a
proof of its undoubted efficacy, said, that, ‘he had had one gentleman
with my complaint under his hands for the last fifteen years.’ This
anecdote made my companion shake the rough sides of his three
great coats with boisterous laughter; and Turtle, starting out of his
sleep, swore he knew how the fight would go, for he had had a
dream about it. Sure enough the rascal told us how the three first
rounds went off, but ‘his dream,’ like others, ‘denoted a foregone
conclusion.’ He knew his men. The moon now rose in silver
state, and I ventured, with some hesitation, to point out this object
of placid beauty, with the blue serene beyond, to the man of science,
to which his ear he ‘seriously inclined,’ the more as it gave promise
<em>d’un beau jour</em> for the morrow, and showed the ring undrenched by
envious showers, arrayed in sunny smiles. Just then, all going on
well, I thought on my friend Toms, whom I had left behind, and
said innocently, ‘There was a blockhead of a fellow I left in town,
who said there was no possibility of getting down by the mail, and
talked of going by a caravan from Belcher’s at two in the morning,
after he had written some letters.’ ‘Why,’ said he of the lapels,
‘I should not wonder if that was the very person we saw running
about like mad from one coach-door to another, and asking if any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>one had seen a friend of his, a gentlemen going to the fight, whom
he had missed stupidly enough by staying to write a note.’ ‘Pray,
Sir,’ said my fellow-traveller, ‘had he a plaid-cloak on?’—‘Why,
no,’ said I, ‘not at the time I left him, but he very well might
afterwards, for he offered to lend me one.’ The plaid-cloak and
the letter decided the thing. Joe, sure enough, was in the Bristol
mail, which preceded us by about fifty yards. This was droll
enough. We had now but a few miles to our place of destination,
and the first thing I did on alighting at Newbury, both coaches
stopping at the same time, was to call out, ‘Pray, is there a gentleman
in that mail of the name of Toms?’ ‘No,’ said Joe, borrowing
something of the vein of Gilpin, ‘for I have just got out.’ ‘Well!’
says he, ‘this is lucky; but you don’t know how vexed I was to
miss you; for,’ added he, lowering his voice, ‘do you know when
I left you I went to Belcher’s to ask about the caravan, and Mrs.
Belcher said very obligingly, she couldn’t tell about that, but there
were two gentlemen who had taken places by the mail and were gone
on in a landau, and she could frank us. It’s a pity I didn’t meet
with you; we could then have got down for nothing. But <em>mum’s the
word</em>.’ It’s the devil for any one to tell me a secret, for it’s sure
to come out in print. I do not care so much to gratify a friend,
but the public ear is too great a temptation to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our present business was to get beds and a supper at an inn; but
this was no easy task. The public-houses were full, and where you
saw a light at a private house, and people poking their heads out of
the casement to see what was going on, they instantly put them in
and shut the window, the moment you seemed advancing with a
suspicious overture for accommodation. Our guard and coachman
thundered away at the outer gate of the Crown for some time without
effect—such was the greater noise within;—and when the doors
were unbarred, and we got admittance, we found a party assembled
in the kitchen round a good hospitable fire, some sleeping, others
drinking, others talking on politics and on the fight. A tall
English yeoman (something like Matthews in the face, and quite
as great a wag)—</p>

<p class='c013'>was making such a prodigious noise about rent and taxes, and the
price of corn now and formerly, that he had prevented us from being
heard at the gate. The first thing I heard him say was to a shuffling
fellow who wanted to be off a bet for a shilling glass of brandy and
water—‘Confound it, man, don’t be <em>insipid</em>!’ Thinks I, that is a
good phrase. It was a good omen. He kept it up so all night,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>nor flinched with the approach of morning. He was a fine fellow,
with sense, wit, and spirit, a hearty body and a joyous mind, free-spoken,
frank, convivial—one of that true English breed that went
with Harry the Fifth to the siege of Harfleur—‘standing like
greyhounds in the slips,’ &#38;c. We ordered tea and eggs (beds were
soon found to be out of the question) and this fellow’s conversation
was <em>sauce piquante</em>. It did one’s heart good to see him brandish his
oaken towel and to hear him talk. He made mince-meat of a
drunken, stupid, red-faced, quarrelsome, <em>frowsy</em> farmer, whose nose
‘he moralized into a thousand similes,’ making it out a firebrand like
Bardolph’s. ‘I’ll tell you what my friend,’ says he, ‘the landlady
has only to keep you here to save fire and candle. If one was to
touch your nose, it would go off like a piece of charcoal.’ At this
the other only grinned like an idiot, the sole variety in his purple
face being his little peering grey eyes and yellow teeth; called for
another glass, swore he would not stand it; and after many attempts
to provoke his humourous antagonist to single combat, which the
other turned off (after working him up to a ludicrous pitch of
choler) with great adroitness, he fell quietly asleep with a glass of
liquor in his hand, which he could not lift to his head. His
laughing persecutor made a speech over him, and turning to the
opposite side of the room, where they were all sleeping in the midst
of this ‘loud and furious fun,’ said, ‘There’s a scene, by G—d, for
Hogarth to paint. I think he and Shakspeare were our two best
men at copying life.’ This confirmed me in my good opinion of
him. Hogarth, Shakspeare, and Nature, were just enough for him
(indeed for any man) to know. I said, ‘You read Cobbett, don’t
you? At least,’ says I, ‘you talk just as well as he writes.’ He
seemed to doubt this. But I said, ‘We have an hour to spare:
if you’ll get pen, ink, and paper, and keep on talking, I’ll write
down what you say; and if it doesn’t make a capital ‘Political
Register,’ I’ll forfeit my head. You have kept me alive to-night,
however. I don’t know what I should have done without you.’ He
did not dislike this view of the thing, nor my asking if he was not
about the size of Jem Belcher; and told me soon afterwards, in the
confidence of friendship, that ‘the circumstance which had given him
nearly the greatest concern in his life, was Cribb’s beating Jem after
he had lost his eye by racket-playing.’—The morning dawns; that
dim but yet clear light appears, which weighs like solid bars of metal
on the sleepless eyelids; the guests drop down from their chambers
one by one—but it was too late to think of going to bed now (the
clock was on the stroke of seven), we had nothing for it but to find a
barber’s (the pole that glittered in the morning sun lighted us to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>shop), and then a nine miles’ march to Hungerford. The day was
fine, the sky was blue, the mists were retiring from the marshy
ground, the path was tolerably dry, the sitting-up all night had not done
us much harm—at least the cause was good; we talked of this and
that with amicable difference, roving and sipping of many subjects,
but still invariably we returned to the fight. At length, a mile to the
left of Hungerford, on a gentle eminence, we saw the ring surrounded
by covered carts, gigs, and carriages, of which hundreds had passed
us on the road; Toms gave a youthful shout, and we hastened down
a narrow lane to the scene of action.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reader, have you ever seen a fight? If not, you have a pleasure
to come, at least if it is a fight like that between the Gas-man and
Bill Neate. The crowd was very great when we arrived on the
spot; open carriages were coming up, with streamers flying and music
playing, and the country people were pouring in over hedge and ditch
in all directions, to see their hero beat or be beaten. The odds were
still on Gas, but only about five to four. Gully had been down to try
Neate, and had backed him considerably, which was a damper to the
sanguine confidence of the adverse party. About two hundred thousand
pounds were pending. The Gas says, he has lost 3000<em>l.</em> which
were promised him by different gentlemen if he had won. He had
presumed too much on himself, which had made others presume on
him. This spirited and formidable young fellow seems to have taken
for his motto the old maxim, that ‘there are three things necessary to
success in life—<em>Impudence! Impudence! Impudence!</em>’ It is so in
matters of opinion, but not in the <em>Fancy</em>, which is the most practical
of all things, though even here confidence is half the battle, but only
half. Our friend had vapoured and swaggered too much, as if he
wanted to grin and bully his adversary out of the fight. ‘Alas! the
Bristol man was not so tamed!’—‘This is <em>the grave-digger</em>’ (would
Tom Hickman exclaim in the moments of intoxication from gin and
success, shewing his tremendous right hand), ‘this will send many of
them to their long homes; I haven’t done with them yet! ‘Why
should he—though he had licked four of the best men within the
hour, yet why should he threaten to inflict dishonourable chastisement
on my old master Richmond, a veteran going off the stage, and who
has borne his sable honours meekly? Magnanimity, my dear Tom,
and bravery, should be inseparable. Or why should he go up to his
antagonist, the first time he ever saw him at the Fives Court, and
measuring him from head to foot with a glance of contempt, as
Achilles surveyed Hector, say to him, ‘What, are you Bill Neate?
I’ll knock more blood out of that great carcase of thine, this day
fortnight, than you ever knock’d out of a bullock’s!’ It was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>manly, ’twas not fighter-like. If he was sure of the victory (as he
was not), the less said about it the better. Modesty should accompany
the <em>Fancy</em> as its shadow. The best men were always the best
behaved. Jem Belcher, the Game Chicken (before whom the Gas-man
could not have lived) were civil, silent men. So is Cribb, so is
Tom Belcher, the most elegant of sparrers, and not a man for every
one to take by the nose. I enlarged on this topic in the mail (while
Turtle was asleep), and said very wisely (as I thought) that impertinence
was a part of no profession. A boxer was bound to beat his
man, but not to thrust his fist, either actually or by implication, in
every one’s face. Even a highwayman, in the way of trade, may
blow out your brains, but if he uses foul language at the same time, I
should say he was no gentleman. A boxer, I would infer, need not
be a blackguard or a coxcomb, more than another. Perhaps I press
this point too much on a fallen man—Mr. Thomas Hickman has by
this time learnt that first of all lessons, ‘That man was made to
mourn.’ He has lost nothing by the late fight but his presumption;
and that every man may do as well without! By an over-display of
this quality, however, the public had been prejudiced against him,
and the <em>knowing-ones</em> were taken in. Few but those who had bet on
him wished Gas to win. With my own prepossessions on the subject,
the result of the 11th of December appeared to me as fine a piece of
poetical justice as I had ever witnessed. The difference of weight
between the two combatants (14 stone to 12) was nothing to the
sporting men. Great, heavy, clumsy, long-armed Bill Neate kicked
the beam in the scale of the Gas-man’s vanity. The amateurs were
frightened at his big words, and thought that they would make up for
the difference of six feet and five feet nine. Truly, the <span class='sc'>Fancy</span> are
not men of imagination. They judge of what has been, and cannot
conceive of anything that is to be. The Gas-man had won hitherto;
therefore he must beat a man half as big again as himself—and that to
a certainty. Besides, there are as many feuds, factions, prejudices,
pedantic notions in the <span class='sc'>Fancy</span> as in the state or in the schools.
Mr. Gully is almost the only cool, sensible man among them, who
exercises an unbiassed discretion, and is not a slave to his passions in
these matters. But enough of reflections, and to our tale. The day,
as I have said, was fine for a December morning. The grass was
wet, and the ground miry, and ploughed up with multitudinous feet,
except that, within the ring itself, there was a spot of virgin-green
closed in and unprofaned by vulgar tread, that shone with dazzling
brightness in the mid-day sun. For it was now noon, and we had an
hour to wait. This is the trying time. It is then the heart sickens,
as you think what the two champions are about, and how short a time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>will determine their fate. After the first blow is struck, there is no
opportunity for nervous apprehensions; you are swallowed up in the
immediate interest of the scene—but</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Between the acting of a dreadful thing</div>
      <div class='line'>And the first motion, all the interim is</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I found it so as I felt the sun’s rays clinging to my back, and saw the
white wintry clouds sink below the verge of the horizon. ‘So, I
thought, my fairest hopes have faded from my sight!—so will the
Gas-man’s glory, or that of his adversary, vanish in an hour.’ The
<em>swells</em> were parading in their white box-coats, the outer ring was
cleared with some bruises on the heads and shins of the rustic
assembly (for the <em>cockneys</em> had been distanced by the sixty-six miles);
the time drew near, I had got a good stand; a bustle, a buzz, ran
through the crowd, and from the opposite side entered Neate, between
his second and bottle-holder. He rolled along, swathed in his loose
great coat, his knock-knees bending under his huge bulk; and, with
a modest cheerful air, threw his hat into the ring. He then just
looked round, and began quietly to undress; when from the other
side there was a similar rush and an opening made, and the Gas-man
came forward with a conscious air of anticipated triumph, too much
like the cock-of-the walk. He strutted about more than became a
hero, sucked oranges with a supercilious air, and threw away the skin
with a toss of his head, and went up and looked at Neate, which was
an act of supererogation. The only sensible thing he did was, as he
strode away from the modern Ajax, to fling out his arms, as if he
wanted to try whether they would do their work that day. By this
time they had stripped, and presented a strong contrast in appearance.
If Neate was like Ajax, ‘with Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear’ the
pugilistic reputation of all Bristol, Hickman might be compared to
Diomed, light, vigorous, elastic, and his back glistened in the sun, as
he moved about, like a panther’s hide. There was now a dead
pause—attention was awe-struck. Who at that moment, big with
a great event, did not draw his breath short—did not feel his
heart throb? All was ready. They tossed up for the sun, and the
Gas-man won. They were led up to the <em>scratch</em>—shook hands, and
went at it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first round every one thought it was all over. After
making play a short time, the Gas-man flew at his adversary like a
tiger, struck five blows in as many seconds, three first, and then
following him as he staggered back, two more, right and left, and
down he fell, a mighty ruin. There was a shout, and I said, ‘There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>is no standing this.’ Neate seemed like a lifeless lump of flesh and
bone, round which the Gas-man’s blows played with the rapidity of
electricity or lightning, and you imagined he would only be lifted up
to be knocked down again. It was as if Hickman held a sword or a
fire in that right hand of his, and directed it against an unarmed body.
They met again, and Neate seemed, not cowed, but particularly
cautious. I saw his teeth clenched together and his brows knit close
against the sun. He held out both his arms at full length straight
before him, like two sledge-hammers, and raised his left an inch or
two higher. The Gas-man could not get over this guard—they
struck mutually and fell, but without advantage on either side. It
was the same in the next round; but the balance of power was thus
restored—the fate of the battle was suspended. No one could tell
how it would end. This was the only moment in which opinion was
divided; for, in the next, the Gas-man aiming a mortal blow at his
adversary’s neck, with his right hand, and failing from the length he
had to reach, the other returned it with his left at full swing, planted
a tremendous blow on his cheek-bone and eyebrow, and made a red
ruin of that side of his face. The Gas-man went down, and there
was another shout—a roar of triumph as the waves of fortune rolled
tumultuously from side to side. This was a settler. Hickman got
up, and ‘grinned horrible a ghastly smile,’ yet he was evidently
dashed in his opinion of himself; it was the first time he had ever
been so punished; all one side of his face was perfect scarlet, and his
right eye was closed in dingy blackness, as he advanced to the fight,
less confident, but still determined. After one or two rounds, not
receiving another such remembrancer, he rallied and went at it
with his former impetuosity. But in vain. His strength had been
weakened,—his blows could not tell at such a distance,—he was
obliged to fling himself at his adversary, and could not strike from
his feet; and almost as regularly as he flew at him with his right
hand, Neate warded the blow, or drew back out of its reach, and
felled him with the return of his left. There was little cautious
sparring—no half-hits—no tapping and trifling, none of the <em>petit-maitreship</em>
of the art—they were almost all knock-down blows:—the
fight was a good stand-up fight. The wonder was the half-minute
time. If there had been a minute or more allowed between each
round, it would have been intelligible how they should by degrees
recover strength and resolution; but to see two men smashed to the
ground, smeared with gore, stunned, senseless, the breath beaten out
of their bodies; and then, before you recover from the shock, to see
them rise up with new strength and courage, stand steady to inflict or
receive mortal offence, and rush upon each other ‘like two clouds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>over the Caspian’—this is the most astonishing thing of all:—this is
the high and heroic state of man! From this time forward the
event became more certain every round; and about the twelfth it
seemed as if it must have been over. Hickman generally stood with
his back to me; but in the scuffle, he had changed positions, and
Neate just then made a tremendous lunge at him, and hit him full in
the face. It was doubtful whether he would fall backwards or
forwards; he hung suspended for a second or two, and then fell
back, throwing his hands in the air, and with his face lifted up to the
sky. I never saw any thing more terrific than his aspect just before
he fell. All traces of life, of natural expression, were gone from
him. His face was like a human skull, a death’s head, spouting
blood. The eyes were filled with blood, the nose streamed with
blood, the mouth gaped blood. He was not like an actual man, but
like a preternatural, spectral appearance, or like one of the figures in
Dante’s <em>Inferno</em>. Yet he fought on after this for several rounds,
still striking the first desperate blow, and Neate standing on the
defensive, and using the same cautious guard to the last, as if he had
still all his work to do; and it was not till the Gas-man was so
stunned in the seventeenth or eighteenth round, that his senses
forsook him, and he could not come to time, that the battle was
declared over.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Ye who despise the Fancy, do something to shew
as much <em>pluck</em>, or as much self-possession as this, before you assume
a superiority which you have never given a single proof of by any one
action in the whole course of your lives!—When the Gas-man came
to himself, the first words he uttered were, ‘Where am I? What
is the matter?’ ‘Nothing is the matter, Tom,—you have lost the
battle, but you are the bravest man alive.’ And Jackson whispered
to him, ‘I am collecting a purse for you, Tom.’—Vain sounds, and
unheard at that moment! Neate instantly went up and shook him
cordially by the hand, and seeing some old acquaintance, began to
flourish with his fists, calling out, ‘Ah you always said I couldn’t
fight—What do you think now?’ But all in good humour, and
without any appearance of arrogance; only it was evident Bill Neate
was pleased that he had won the fight. When it was over, I asked
Cribb if he did not think it was a good one? He said, ‘<em>Pretty
well!</em>’ The carrier-pigeons now mounted into the air, and one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>them flew with the news of her husband’s victory to the bosom of
Mrs. Neate. Alas, for Mrs. Hickman!</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Mais au revoir</em>, as Sir Fopling Flutter says. I went down with
Toms; I returned with Jack Pigott, whom I met on the ground.
Toms is a rattle brain; Pigott is a sentimentalist. Now, under
favour, I am a sentimentalist too—therefore I say nothing, but that
the interest of the excursion did not flag as I came back. Pigott
and I marched along the causeway leading from Hungerford to Newbury,
now observing the effect of a brilliant sun on the tawny meads
or moss-coloured cottages, now exulting in the fight, now digressing
to some topic of general and elegant literature. My friend was
dressed in character for the occasion, or like one of the <span class='sc'>Fancy</span>; that
is, with a double portion of great coats, clogs, and overhauls: and
just as we had agreed with a couple of country lads to carry his
superfluous wearing apparel to the next town, we were overtaken by
a return post-chaise, into which I got, Pigott preferring a seat on the
bar. There were two strangers already in the chaise, and on their
observing they supposed I had been to the fight, I said I had, and
concluded they had done the same. They appeared, however, a little
shy and sore on the subject; and it was not till after several hints
dropped, and questions put, that it turned out that they had missed it.
One of these friends had undertaken to drive the other there in his
gig: they had set out, to make sure work, the day before at three in
the afternoon. The owner of the one-horse vehicle scorned to ask
his way, and drove right on to Bagshot, instead of turning off at
Hounslow: there they stopped all night, and set off the next day
across the country to Reading, from whence they took coach, and
got down within a mile or two of Hungerford, just half an hour after
the fight was over. This might be safely set down as one of the
miseries of human life. We parted with these two gentlemen who
had been to see the fight, but had returned as they went, at
Wolhampton, where we were promised beds (an irresistible temptation,
for Pigott had passed the preceding night at Hungerford as we
had done at Newbury), and we turned into an old bow-windowed
parlour with a carpet and a snug fire; and after devouring a quantity
of tea, toast, and eggs, sat down to consider, during an hour of
philosophic leisure, what we should have for supper. In the midst
of an Epicurean deliberation between a roasted fowl and mutton
chops with mashed potatoes, we were interrupted by an inroad of
Goths and Vandals—<i><span lang="la">O procul este profani</span></i>—not real flash-men, but
interlopers, noisy pretenders, butchers from Tothill-fields, brokers
from Whitechapel, who called immediately for pipes and tobacco,
hoping it would not be disagreeable to the gentlemen, and began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>insist that it was <em>a cross</em>. Pigott withdrew from the smoke and noise
into another room, and left me to dispute the point with them for a
couple of hours <em>sans intermission</em> by the dial. The next morning we
rose refreshed; and on observing that Jack had a pocket volume in
his hand, in which he read in the intervals of our discourse, I
inquired what it was, and learned to my particular satisfaction that
it was a volume of the New Eloise. Ladies, after this, will you
contend that a love for the <span class='sc'>Fancy</span> is incompatible with the cultivation
of sentiment?—We jogged on as before, my friend setting me up in
a genteel drab great coat and green silk handkerchief (which I must
say became me exceedingly), and after stretching our legs for a few
miles, and seeing Jack Randall, Ned Turner, and Scroggins, pass on
the top of one of the Bath coaches, we engaged with the driver of
the second to take us to London for the usual fee. I got inside, and
found three other passengers. One of them was an old gentleman
with an aquiline nose, powdered hair, and a pigtail, and who looked
as if he had played many a rubber at the Bath rooms. I said to
myself, he is very like Mr. Windham; I wish he would enter into
conversation, that I might hear what fine observations would come
from those finely-turned features. However, nothing passed, till,
stopping to dine at Reading, some inquiry was made by the company
about the fight, and I gave (as the reader may believe) an eloquent
and animated description of it. When we got into the coach again,
the old gentleman, after a graceful exordium, said, he had, when a
boy, been to a fight between the famous Broughton and George
Stevenson, who was called the <em>Fighting Coachman</em>, in the year 1770,
with the late Mr. Windham. This beginning flattered the spirit of
prophecy within me and rivetted my attention. He went on—‘George
Stevenson was coachman to a friend of my father’s. He
was an old man when I saw him some years afterwards. He took
hold of his own arm and said, “there was muscle here once, but now
it is no more than this young gentleman’s.” He added, “well, no
matter; I have been here long, I am willing to go hence, and I hope
I have done no more harm than another man.” Once,’ said my unknown
companion, ‘I asked him if he had ever beat Broughton?
He said Yes; that he had fought with him three times, and the last
time he fairly beat him, though the world did not allow it. “I’ll tell
you how it was, master. When the seconds lifted us up in the last
round, we were so exhausted that neither of us could stand, and we
fell upon one another, and as Master Broughton fell uppermost, the
mob gave it in his favour, and he was said to have won the battle.
But,” says he, “the fact was, that as his second (John Cuthbert)
lifted him up, he said to him, ‘I’ll fight no more, I’ve had enough;’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>which,” says Stevenson, “you know gave me the victory. And to
prove to you that this was the case, when John Cuthbert was on his
death-bed, and they asked him if there was any thing on his mind
which he wished to confess, he answered, ‘Yes, that there was one
thing he wished to set right, for that certainly Master Stevenson won
that last fight with Master Broughton; for he whispered him as he
lifted him up in the last round of all, that he had had enough.’”’
‘This,’ said the Bath gentleman, ‘was a bit of human nature;’ and I
have written this account of the fight on purpose that it might not be
lost to the world. He also stated as a proof of the candour of mind
in this class of men, that Stevenson acknowledged that Broughton
could have beat him in his best day; but that he (Broughton) was
getting old in their last rencounter. When we stopped in Piccadilly,
I wanted to ask the gentleman some questions about the late Mr.
Windham, but had not courage. I got out, resigned my coat and
green silk handkerchief to Pigott (loth to part with these ornaments
of life), and walked home in high spirits.</p>

<p class='c007'>P.S. Toms called upon me the next day, to ask me if I did not
think the fight was a complete thing? I said I thought it was. I
hope he will relish my account of it.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MERRY ENGLAND</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The New Monthly Magazine.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>December, 1825.</em></span></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>‘St. George for merry England!’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This old-fashioned epithet might be supposed to have been bestowed
ironically, or on the old principle—<i><span lang="la">Ut lucus a non lucendo</span></i>. Yet there
is something in the sound that hits the fancy, and a sort of truth
beyond appearances. To be sure, it is from a dull, homely ground
that the gleams of mirth and jollity break out; but the streaks of light
that tinge the evening sky are not the less striking on that account.
The beams of the morning sun shining on the lonely glades, or through
the idle branches of the tangled forest, the leisure, the freedom, ‘the
pleasure of going and coming without knowing where,’ the troops of
wild deer, the sports of the chase, and other rustic gambols, were
sufficient to justify the well-known appellation of ‘Merry Sherwood,’
and in like manner, we may apply the phrase to <em>Merry England</em>.
The smile is not the less sincere because it does not always play upon
the cheek; and the jest is not the less welcome, nor the laugh less
hearty, because they happen to be a relief from care or leaden-eyed
melancholy. The instances are the more precious as they are rare;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and we look forward to them with the greater good will, or back
upon them with the greater gratitude, as we drain the last drop in the
cup with particular relish. If not always gay or in good spirits, we
are glad when any occasion draws us out of our natural gloom, and
disposed to make the most of it. We may say with <em>Silence</em> in the
play, ‘I have been merry once ere now,’—and this once was to serve
him all his life; for he was a person of wonderful silence and gravity,
though ‘he chirped over his cups,’ and announced with characteristic
glee that ‘there were pippins and cheese to come.’ <em>Silence</em> was in
this sense a merry man, that is, he would be merry if he could, and
a very great economy of wit, like very slender fare, was a banquet to
him, from the simplicity of his taste and habits. ‘Continents,’ says
Hobbes, ‘have most of what they contain’—and in this view it may
be contended that the English are the merriest people in the world,
since they only show it on high-days and holidays. They are then
like a schoolboy let loose from school, or like a dog that has slipped
his collar. They are not gay like the French, who are one eternal
smile of self-complacency, tortured into affectation, or spun into
languid indifference, nor are they voluptuous and immersed in sensual
indolence, like the Italians; but they have that sort of intermittent,
fitful, irregular gaiety, which is neither worn out by habit, nor
deadened by passion, but is sought with avidity as it takes the mind
by surprise, is startled by a sense of oddity and incongruity, indulges
its wayward humours or lively impulses, with perfect freedom and
lightness of heart, and seizes occasion by the forelock, that it may
return to serious business with more cheerfulness, and have something
to beguile the hours of thought or sadness. I do not see how there
can be high spirits without low ones; and every thing has its price
according to circumstances. Perhaps we have to pay a heavier tax
on pleasure, than some others: what skills it, so long as our good
spirits and good hearts enable us to bear it?</p>

<p class='c007'>‘They’ (the English), says Froissart, ‘amused themselves sadly
after the fashion of their country’—<i><span lang="fr">ils se réjouissent  tristement selon
la coutume de leur pays</span></i>. They have indeed a way of their own.
Their mirth is a relaxation from gravity, a challenge to dull care to
be gone; and one is not always clear at first, whether the appeal is
successful. The cloud may still hang on the brow; the ice may not
thaw at once. To help them out in their new character is an act of
charity. Any thing short of hanging or drowning is something to
begin with. They do not enter into their amusements the less
doggedly because they may plague others. They like a thing the
better for hitting them a rap on the knuckles, for making their blood
tingle. They do not dance or sing, but they make good cheer—‘eat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>drink, and are merry.’ No people are fonder of field-sports, Christmas
gambols, or practical jests. Blindman’s-buff, hunt-the-slipper, hot-cockles,
and snap-dragon, are all approved English games, full of
laughable surprises and ‘hairbreadth ‘scapes,’ and serve to amuse the
winter fire-side after the roast-beef and plum-pudding, the spiced ale
and roasted crab, thrown (hissing-hot) into the foaming tankard.
Punch (not the liquor, but the puppet) is not, I fear, of English
origin; but there is no place, I take it, where he finds himself more
at home or meets a more joyous welcome, where he collects greater
crowds at the corners of streets, where he opens the eyes or distends
the cheeks wider, or where the bangs and blows, the uncouth gestures,
ridiculous anger and screaming voice of the chief performer excite
more boundless merriment or louder bursts of laughter among all ranks
and sorts of people. An English theatre is the very throne of
pantomime; nor do I believe that the gallery and boxes of Drury Lane
or Covent Garden filled on the proper occasions with holiday folks
(big or little) yield the palm for undisguised, tumultuous, inextinguishable
laughter to any spot in Europe. I do not speak of the refinement
of the mirth (this is no fastidious speculation) but of its cordiality, on
the return of these long looked-for and licensed periods; and I may
add here, by way of illustration, that the English common people are
a sort of grown children, spoiled and sulky perhaps, but full of glee
and merriment, when their attention is drawn off by some sudden and
striking object. The May-pole is almost gone out of fashion among
us: but May-day, besides its flowering hawthorns and its pearly dews,
has still its boasted exhibition of painted chimney-sweepers and their
Jack-o’-the-Green, whose tawdry finery, bedizened faces, unwonted
gestures, and short-lived pleasures call forth good-humoured smiles and
looks of sympathy in the spectators. There is no place where trap-ball,
fives, prison-base, foot-ball, quoits, bowls are better understood or
more successfully practised; and the very names of a cricket bat and
ball make English fingers tingle. What happy days must ‘Long
Robinson’ have passed in getting ready his wickets and mending his
bats, who when two of the fingers of his right hand were struck off
by the violence of a ball, had a screw fastened to it to hold the bat,
and with the other hand still sent the ball thundering against the
boards that bounded <em>Old Lord’s cricket-ground</em>! What delightful
hours must have been his in looking forward to the matches that were
to come, in recounting the feats he had performed in those that were
past! I have myself whiled away whole mornings in seeing him
strike the ball (like a countryman mowing with a scythe) to the
farthest extremity of the smooth, level, sun-burnt ground, and with
long, awkward strides count the notches that made victory sure!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Then again, cudgel-playing, quarter-staff, bull and badger-baiting,
cock-fighting are almost the peculiar diversions of this island, and often
objected to us as barbarous and cruel; horse-racing is the delight and
the ruin of numbers; and the noble science of boxing is all our own.
Foreigners can scarcely understand how we can squeeze pleasure out
of this pastime; the luxury of hard blows given or received; the joy
of the ring; nor the perseverance of the combatants.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The English
also excel, or are not excelled in wiring a hare, in stalking a deer, in
shooting, fishing, and hunting. England to this day boasts her Robin
Hood and his merry men, that stout archer and outlaw, and patron saint
of the sporting-calendar. What a cheerful sound is that of the
hunters, issuing from the autumnal wood and sweeping over hill and
dale!</p>

<p class='c013'>What sparkling richness in the scarlet coats of the riders, what a
glittering confusion in the pack, what spirit in the horses, what eagerness
in the followers on foot, as they disperse over the plain, or force
their way over hedge and ditch! Surely, the coloured prints and
pictures of these, hung up in gentlemen’s halls and village alehouses,
however humble as works of art, have more life and health and spirit
in them, and mark the pith and nerve of the national character more
creditably than the mawkish, sentimental, affected designs of Theseus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and Pirithous, and Æneas and Dido, pasted on foreign <em>salons à manger</em>,
and the interior of country-houses. If our tastes are not epic, nor our
pretensions lofty, they are simple and our own; and we may possibly
enjoy our native rural sports, and the rude remembrances of them, with
the truer relish on this account, that they are suited to us and we to
them. The English nation, too, are naturally ‘brothers of the angle.’
This pursuit implies just that mixture of patience and pastime, of
vacancy and thoughtfulness, of idleness and business, of pleasure and
of pain, which is suited to the genius of an Englishman, and as I
suspect, of no one else in the same degree. He is eminently gifted to
stand in the situation assigned by Dr. Johnson to the angler, ‘at one
end of a rod with a worm at the other.’ I should suppose no
language can show such a book as an often-mentioned one, ‘Walton’s
Complete Angler,’—so full of <em>naïveté</em>, of unaffected sprightliness,
of busy trifling, of dainty songs, of refreshing brooks, of shady
arbours, of happy thoughts and of the herb called <em>Heart’s Ease</em>!
Some persons can see neither the wit nor wisdom of this genuine
volume, as if a book as well as a man might not have a personal
character belonging to it, amiable, venerable from the spirit of joy and
thorough goodness it manifests, independently of acute remarks or
scientific discoveries: others object to the cruelty of Walton’s theory
and practice of trout-fishing—for my part, I should as soon charge an
infant with cruelty for killing a fly, and I feel the same sort of pleasure
in reading his book as I should have done in the company of this
happy, child-like old man, watching his ruddy cheek, his laughing eye,
the kindness of his heart, and the dexterity of his hand in seizing his
finny prey! It must be confessed, there is often an odd sort of
<em>materiality</em> in English sports and recreations. I have known several
persons, whose existence consisted wholly in manual exercises, and
all whose enjoyments lay at their finger-ends. Their greatest happiness
was in cutting a stick, in mending a cabbage-net, in digging a hole
in the ground, in hitting a mark, turning a lathe, or in something else
of the same kind, at which they had a certain <em>knack</em>. Well is it
when we can amuse ourselves with such trifles and without injury to
others! This class of character, which the Spectator has immortalised
in the person of Will Wimble, is still common among younger
brothers and gentlemen of retired incomes in town or country. The
<em>Cockney</em> character is of our English growth, as this intimates a feverish
fidgety delight in rural sights and sounds, and a longing wish, after
the turmoil and confinement of a city-life, to transport one’s-self to the
freedom and breathing sweetness of a country retreat. London is
half suburbs. The suburbs of Paris are a desert; and you see nothing
but crazy wind-mills, stone-walls, and a few straggling visitants in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>spots where in England you would find a thousand villas, a thousand
terraces crowned with their own delights, or be stunned with the
noise of bowling-greens and tea-gardens, or stifled with the fumes of
tobacco mingling with fragrant shrubs, or the clouds of dust raised by
half the population of the metropolis panting and toiling in search of
a mouthful of fresh air. The Parisian is, perhaps, as well (or better)
contented with himself wherever he is, stewed in his shop or his
garret; the Londoner is miserable in these circumstances, and glad to
escape from them.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Let no one object to the gloomy appearance of
a London Sunday, compared with a Parisian one. It is a part of our
politics and our religion: we would not have James the First’s ‘Book
of Sports’ thrust down our throats: and besides, it is a part of our
character to do one thing at a time, and not to be dancing a jig and
on our knees in the same breath. It is true the Englishman spends
his Sunday evening at the alehouse—</p>

<p class='c013'>but he only unbends and waxes mellow by degrees, and sits soaking
till he can neither sit, stand, nor go: it is his vice, and a beastly one
it is, but not a proof of any inherent distaste to mirth or good-fellowship.
Neither can foreigners throw the carnival in our teeth with
any effect: those who have seen it (at Florence, for example), will
say that it is duller than any thing in England. Our Bartholomew-Fair
is Queen Mab herself to it! What can be duller than a parcel
of masks moving about the streets and looking as grave and monotonous
as possible from day to day, and with the same lifeless formality
in their limbs and gestures as in their features? One might as well
expect variety and spirit in a procession of wax-work. We must be
hard run indeed, when we have recourse to a pasteboard proxy to set
off our mirth: a mask may be a very good cover for licentiousness
(though of that I saw no signs), but it is a very bad exponent of wit
and humour. I should suppose there is more drollery and unction in
the caricatures in Gilray’s shop-window, than in all the masks in Italy,
without exception.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The humour of English writing and description has often been
wondered at; and it flows from the same source as the merry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><em>traits</em> of our character. A degree of barbarism and rusticity seems
necessary to the perfection of humour. The droll and laughable
depend on peculiarity and incongruity of character. But with the
progress of refinement, the peculiarities of individuals and of classes
wear out or lose their sharp, abrupt edges; nay, a certain slowness
and dulness of understanding is required to be struck with odd and
unaccountable appearances, for which a greater facility of apprehension
can sooner assign an explanation that breaks the force of the seeming
absurdity, and to which a wider scope of imagination is more easily
reconciled. Clowns and country people are more amused, are more
disposed to laugh and make sport of the dress of strangers, because
from their ignorance the surprise is greater, and they cannot conceive
any thing to be natural or proper to which they are unused. Without
a given portion of hardness and repulsiveness of feeling the ludicrous
cannot well exist. Wonder, and curiosity, the attributes of inexperience,
enter greatly into its composition. Now it appears to me
that the English are (or were) just at that mean point between
intelligence and obtuseness, which must produce the most abundant
and happiest crop of humour. Absurdity and singularity glide over
the French mind without jarring or jostling with it; or they evaporate
in levity:—with the Italians they are lost in indolence or
pleasure. The ludicrous takes hold of the English imagination,
and clings to it with all its ramifications. We resent any difference
or peculiarity of appearance at first, and yet, having not much malice
at our hearts, we are glad to turn it into a jest—we are liable to be
offended, and as willing to be pleased—struck with oddity from not
knowing what to make of it, we wonder and burst out a laughing at
the eccentricity of others, while we follow our own bent from wilfulness
or simplicity, and thus afford them, in our turn, matter for the
indulgence of the comic vein. It is possible that a greater refinement
of manners may give birth to finer distinctions of satire and a nicer
tact for the ridiculous: but our insular situation and character are, I
should say, most likely to foster, as they have in fact fostered, the
greatest quantity of natural and striking humour, in spite of our
plodding tenaciousness, and want both of gaiety and quickness of
perception. A set of raw recruits with their awkward movements
and unbending joints are laughable enough: but they cease to be so,
when they have once been drilled into discipline and uniformity.
So it is with nations that lose their angular points and grotesque
qualities with education and intercourse: but it is in a mixed state
of manners that comic humour chiefly flourishes, for, in order that
the drollery may not be lost, we must have spectators of the passing
scene who are able to appreciate and embody its most remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>features,—wits as well as <em>butts</em> for ridicule. I shall mention two
names in this department, which may serve to redeem the national
character from absolute dulness and solemn pretence,—Fielding and
Hogarth. These were thorough specimens of true English humour;
yet both were grave men. In reality, too high a pitch of animal
spirits runs away with the imagination, instead of helping it to reach
the goal; is inclined to take the jest for granted when it ought to
work it out with patient and marked touches, and it ends in vapid
flippancy and impertinence. Among our neighbours on the Continent,
Moliere and Rabelais carried the freedom of wit and humour to an
almost incredible height; but they rather belonged to the old French
school, and even approach and exceed the English licence and
extravagance of conception. I do not consider Congreve’s wit
(though it belongs to us) as coming under the article here spoken of;
for his genius is any thing but <em>merry</em>. Lord Byron was in the habit
of railing at the spirit of our good old comedy, and of abusing
Shakspeare’s Clowns and Fools, which he said the refinement of the
French and Italian stage would not endure, and which only our
grossness and puerile taste could tolerate. In this I agree with him;
and it is <em>pat</em> to my purpose. I flatter myself that we are almost the
only people left who understand and relish <em>nonsense</em>. We are not
‘merry and wise,’ but indulge our mirth to excess and folly. When we
trifle, we trifle in good earnest; and having once relaxed our hold of
the helm, drift idly down the stream, and delighted with the change
are tossed about ‘by every little breath’ of whim or caprice,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That under Heaven is blown.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>All we then want is to proclaim a truce with reason, and to be
pleased with as little expense of thought or pretension to wisdom as
possible. This licensed fooling is carried to its very utmost length
in Shakspeare, and in some other of our elder dramatists, without,
perhaps, sufficient warrant or the same excuse. Nothing can justify
this extreme relaxation but extreme tension. Shakspeare’s trifling
does indeed tread upon the very borders of vacancy: his meaning
often hangs by the very slenderest threads. For this he might be
blamed if it did not take away our breath to follow his eagle flights,
or if he did not at other times make the cordage of our hearts crack.
After our heads ache with thinking, it is fair to play the fool. The
clowns were as proper an appendage to the gravity of our antique
literature, as fools and dwarfs were to the stately dignity of courts
and noble houses in former days. Of all people, they have the best
right to claim a total exemption from rules and rigid formality, who,
when they have any thing of importance to do, set about it with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>greatest earnestness and perseverance, and are generally grave and
sober to a proverb.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Poor Swift, who wrote more idle or <em>nonsense</em>
verses than any man, was the severest of moralists; and his feelings
and observations morbidly acute. Did not Lord Byron himself
follow up his Childe Harold with his Don Juan?—not that I insist
on what he did as an illustration of the English character. He was
one of the English Nobility, not one of the English People; and his
occasional ease and familiarity were in my mind equally constrained
and affected, whether in relation to the pretensions of his rank or the
efforts of his genius.</p>

<p class='c007'>They ask you in France, how you pass your time in England
without amusements; and can with difficulty believe that there are
theatres in London, still less that they are larger and handsomer than
those in Paris. That we should have comic actors, ‘they own,
surprises them.’ They judge of the English character in the lump
as one great jolter-head, containing all the stupidity of the country,
as the large ball at the top of the Dispensary in Warwick-lane, from
its resemblance to a gilded pill, has been made to represent the whole
pharmacopœia and professional quackery of the kingdom. They
have no more notion, for instance, how we should have such an actor
as Liston on our stage, than if we were to tell them we have parts
performed by a sea-otter; nor if they were to see him, would they
be much the wiser, or know what to think of his unaccountable
twitches of countenance or nondescript gestures, of his teeth chattering
in his head, his eyes that seem dropping from their sockets, his
nose that is tickled by a jest as by a feather and shining with self-complacency
as if oiled, his ignorant conceit, his gaping stupor, his
lumpish vivacity in Lubin Log or Tony Lumpkin; for as our rivals
do not wind up the machine to such a determined intensity of purpose,
neither have they any idea of its running down to such degrees of
imbecility and folly, or coming to an absolute <em>stand still</em> and lack
of meaning, nor can they enter into or be amused with the contrast.
No people ever laugh heartily who can give a reason for their doing
so: and I believe the English in general are not yet in this predicament.
They are not metaphysical, but very much in a state of
nature; and this is one main ground why I give them credit for
being merry, notwithstanding appearances. Their mirth is not the
mirth of vice or desperation, but of innocence and a native wildness.
They do not cavil or boggle at niceties, and not merely come to the
edge of a joke, but break their necks over it with a wanton ‘Here
goes,’ where others make a <em>pirouette</em> and stand upon decorum. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>French cannot, however, be persuaded of the excellence of our comic
stage, nor of the store we set by it. When they ask what amusements
we have, it is plain they can never have heard of Mrs. Jordan,
nor King, nor Bannister, nor Suett, nor Munden, nor Lewis, nor little
Simmons, nor Dodd, and Parsons, and Emery, and Miss Pope, and
Miss Farren, and all those who even in my time have gladdened a
nation and ‘made life’s business like a summer’s dream.’ Can I think
of them, and of their names that glittered in the playbills when I was
young, exciting all the flutter of hope and expectation of seeing them
in their favourite parts of Nell, or Little Pickle, or Touchstone, or
Sir Peter Teazle, or Lenitive in the Prize, or Lingo, or Crabtree,
or Nipperkin, or old Dornton, or Ranger, or the Copper Captain, or
Lord Sands, or Filch, or Moses, or Sir Andrew Aguecheek, or
Acres, or Elbow, or Hodge, or Flora, or the Duenna, or Lady
Teazle, or Lady Grace, or of the gaiety that sparkled in all eyes,
and the delight that overflowed all hearts, as they glanced before us
in these parts,</p>

<p class='c013'>and not feel my heart yearn within me, or couple the thoughts of
England and the spleen together? Our cloud has at least its rainbow
tints; ours is not one long polar night of cold and dulness, but we
have the gleaming lights of fancy to amuse us, the household fires of
truth and genius to warm us. We can go to a play and see Liston;
or stay at home and read Roderick Random; or have Hogarth’s
prints of <em>Marriage à la Mode</em> hanging round our room. ‘Tut!
there’s livers even in England,’ as well as ‘out of it.’ We are not
quite the <em>forlorn hope</em> of humanity, the last of nations. The French
look at us across the Channel, and seeing nothing but water and a
cloudy mist, think that this is England.</p>

<p class='c013'>If they have any farther idea of us, it is of George <span class='fss'>III.</span> and our Jack
tars, the House of Lords and House of Commons, and this is no
great addition to us. To go beyond this, to talk of arts and
elegances as having taken up their abode here, or to say that Mrs.
Abington was equal to Mademoiselle Mars, and that we at one time
got up the ‘School for Scandal,’ as they do the ‘Misanthrope,’ is to
persuade them that Iceland is a pleasant summer-retreat, or to recommend
the whale-fishery as a classical amusement. The French are
the <em>cockneys</em> of Europe, and have no idea how any one can exist out
of Paris, or be alive without incessant grimace and <em>jabber</em>. Yet what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>imports it? What! though the joyous train I have just enumerated
were, perhaps, never heard of in the precincts of the Palais-Royal, is
it not enough that they gave pleasure where they were, to those who
saw and heard them? Must our laugh, to be sincere, have its echo
on the other side of the water? Had not the French their favourites
and their enjoyments at the time, that we knew nothing of? Why
then should we not have ours (and boast of them too) without their
leave? A monopoly of self-conceit is not a monopoly of all other
advantages. The English, when they go abroad, do not take away
the prejudice against them by their looks. We seem duller and
sadder than we are. As I write this, I am sitting in the open air in
a beautiful valley, near Vevey: Clarens is on my left, the Dent de
Jamant is behind me, the rocks of Meillerie opposite: under my
feet is a green bank, enamelled with white and purple flowers, in
which a dew-drop here and there still glitters with pearly light—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Intent upon the scene and upon the thoughts that stir within me, I
conjure up the cheerful passages of my life, and a crowd of happy
images appear before me. No one would see it in my looks—my
eyes grow dull and fixed, and I seem rooted to the spot, as all this
phantasmagoria passes in review before me, glancing a reflex lustre
on the face of the world and nature. But the traces of pleasure, in
my case, sink into an absorbent ground of thoughtful melancholy,
and require to be brought out by time and circumstances, or (as the
critics tell you) by the <em>varnish</em> of style!</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>comfort</em>, on which the English lay so much stress, is of the
same character, and arises from the same source as their mirth. Both
exist by contrast and a sort of contradiction. The English are
certainly the most uncomfortable of all people in themselves, and
therefore it is that they stand in need of every kind of comfort
and accommodation. The least thing puts them out of their way,
and therefore every thing must be in its place. They are mightily
offended at disagreeable tastes and smells, and therefore they exact
the utmost neatness and nicety. They are sensible of heat and cold,
and therefore they cannot exist, unless every thing is snug and warm,
or else open and airy, where they are. They must have ‘all
appliances and means to boot.’ They are afraid of interruption and
intrusion, and therefore they shut themselves up in in-door enjoyments
and by their own firesides. It is not that they require luxuries (for
that implies a high degree of epicurean indulgence and gratification),
but they cannot do without <em>their comforts</em>; that is, whatever tends to
supply their physical wants, and ward off physical pain and annoyance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>As they have not a fund of animal spirits and enjoyments in themselves,
they cling to external objects for support, and derive solid
satisfaction from the ideas of order, cleanliness, plenty, property, and
domestic quiet, as they seek for diversion from odd accidents and
grotesque surprises, and have the highest possible relish not of
voluptuous softness, but of hard knocks and dry blows, as one means
of ascertaining their personal identity.</p>

retorted A——, ‘there it is; then I suppose you would prefer
seeing him and Milton instead?’—‘No,’ said B——, ‘neither. I
have seen so much of Shakspeare on the stage and on book-stalls, in
frontispieces and on mantle-pieces, that I am quite tired of the everlasting
repetition: and as to Milton’s face, the impressions that have
come down to us of it I do not like; it is too starched and puritanical;
and I should be afraid of losing some of the manna of his
poetry in the leaven of his countenance and the precisian’s band and
gown.’—‘I shall guess no more,’ said A——. ‘Who is it, then,
you would like to see “in his habit as he lived,” if you had your
choice of the whole range of English literature?’ B—— then named
Sir Thomas Brown and Fulke Greville, the friend of Sir Philip
Sidney, as the two worthies whom he should feel the greatest
pleasure to encounter on the floor of his apartment in their nightgown
and slippers, and to exchange friendly greeting with them. At
this A—— laughed outright, and conceived B—— was jesting with
him; but as no one followed his example, he thought there might be
something in it, and waited for an explanation in a state of whimsical
suspense. B—— then (as well as I can remember a conversation
that passed twenty years ago—how time slips!) went on as follows.
‘The reason why I pitch upon these two authors is, that their
writings are riddles, and they themselves the most mysterious of
personages. They resemble the soothsayers of old, who dealt in
dark hints and doubtful oracles; and I should like to ask them the
meaning of what no mortal but themselves, I should suppose, can
fathom. There is Dr. Johnson, I have no curiosity, no strange
uncertainty about him: he and Boswell together have pretty well let
me into the secret of what passed through his mind. He and other
writers like him are sufficiently explicit: my friends, whose repose I
should be tempted to disturb, (were it in my power) are implicit,
inextricable, inscrutable.</p>

      <div class='line'>The story of Cambuscan bold.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>‘When I look at that obscure but gorgeous prose-composition (the
<em>Urn-burial</em>) I seem to myself to look into a deep abyss, at the bottom
of which are hid pearls and rich treasure; or it is like a stately
labyrinth of doubt and withering speculation, and I would invoke the
spirit of the author to lead me through it. Besides, who would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>be curious to see the lineaments of a man who, having himself been
twice married, wished that mankind were propagated like trees! As
to Fulke Greville, he is like nothing but one of his own “Prologues
spoken by the ghost of an old king of Ormus,” a truly formidable
and inviting personage: his style is apocalyptical, cabalistical, a knot
worthy of such an apparition to untie; and for the unravelling a
passage or two, I would stand the brunt of an encounter with so
portentous a commentator!’—‘I am afraid in that case,’ said A——,
‘that if the mystery were once cleared up, the merit might be lost;‘—and
turning to me, whispered a friendly apprehension, that while
B—— continued to admire these old crabbed authors, he would never
become a popular writer. Dr. Donne was mentioned as a writer of
the same period, with a very interesting countenance, whose history
was singular, and whose meaning was often quite as <em>uncomeatable</em>,
without a personal citation from the dead, as that of any of his
contemporaries. The volume was produced; and while some one
was expatiating on the exquisite simplicity and beauty of the portrait
prefixed to the old edition, A—— got hold of the poetry, and
exclaiming ‘What have we here?’ read the following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Here lies a She-Sun and a He-Moon there,</div>
      <div class='line'>She gives the best light to his sphere,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or each is both and all, and so</div>
      <div class='line'>They unto one another nothing owe.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There was no resisting this, till B——, seizing the volume, turned
to the beautiful ‘Lines to his Mistress,’ dissuading her from accompanying
him abroad, and read them with suffused features and a
faltering tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some one then inquired of B—— if we could not see from the
window the Temple-walk in which Chaucer used to take his exercise;
and on his name being put to the vote, I was pleased to find that there
was a general sensation in his favour in all but A——, who said
something about the ruggedness of the metre, and even objected to
the quaintness of the orthography. I was vexed at this superficial
gloss, pertinaciously reducing every thing to its own trite level, and
asked ‘if he did not think it would be worth while to scan the eye
that had first greeted the Muse in that dim twilight and early dawn
of English literature; to see the head, round which the visions of
fancy must have played like gleams of inspiration or a sudden glory;
to watch those lips that “lisped in numbers, for the numbers came”—as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>by a miracle, or as if the dumb should speak? Nor was it alone
that he had been the first to tune his native tongue (however imperfectly
to modern ears); but he was himself a noble, manly character,
standing before his age and striving to advance it; a pleasant humourist
withal, who has not only handed down to us the living manners of
his time, but had, no doubt, store of curious and quaint devices,
and would make as hearty a companion as Mine Host of Tabard.
His interview with Petrarch is fraught with interest. Yet I would
rather have seen Chaucer in company with the author of the
Decameron, and have heard them exchange their best stories together,
the Squire’s Tale against the Story of the Falcon, the Wife of Bath’s
Prologue against the Adventures of Friar Albert. How fine to see
the high mysterious brow which learning then wore, relieved by the
gay, familiar tone of men of the world, and by the courtesies of
genius. Surely, the thoughts and feelings which passed through the
minds of these great revivers of learning, these Cadmuses who sowed
the teeth of letters, must have stamped an expression on their
features, as different from the moderns as their books, and well worth
the perusal. Dante,’ I continued, ‘is as interesting a person as his
own Ugolino, one whose lineaments curiosity would as eagerly devour
in order to penetrate his spirit, and the only one of the Italian poets
I should care much to see. There is a fine portrait of Ariosto by no
less a hand than Titian’s; light, Moorish, spirited, but not answering
our idea. The same artist’s large colossal profile of Peter Aretine is
the only likeness of the kind that has the effect of conversing with
“the mighty dead,” and this is truly spectral, ghastly, necromantic.’
B—— put it to me if I should like to see Spenser as well as Chaucer;
and I answered without hesitation, ‘No; for that his beauties were
ideal, visionary, not palpable or personal, and therefore connected
with less curiosity about the man. His poetry was the essence of
romance, a very halo round the bright orb of fancy; and the bringing
in the individual might dissolve the charm. No tones of voice could
come up to the mellifluous cadence of his verse; no form but of a
winged angel could vie with the airy shapes he has described. He
was (to our apprehensions) rather “a creature of the element, that
lived in the rainbow and played in the plighted clouds,” than an
ordinary mortal. Or if he did appear, I should wish it to be as a
mere vision, like one of his own pageants, and that he should pass by
unquestioned like a dream or sound—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Captain C. muttered something about Columbus, and M. C. hinted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>at the Wandering Jew; but the last was set aside as spurious, and the
first made over to the New World.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘I should like,’ said Miss D——, ‘to have seen Pope talking with
Patty Blount; and I <em>have</em> seen Goldsmith.’ Every one turned
round to look at Miss D——, as if by so doing they too could get a
sight of Goldsmith.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Where,’ asked a harsh croaking voice, ‘was Dr. Johnson in the
years 1745–6? He did not write any thing that we know of, nor is
there any account of him in Boswell during those two years. Was
he in Scotland with the Pretender? He seems to have passed
through the scenes in the Highlands in company with Boswell many
years after “with lack-lustre eye,” yet as if they were familiar to
him, or associated in his mind with interests that he durst not explain.
If so, it would be an additional reason for my liking him; and I
would give something to have seen him seated in the tent with the
youthful Majesty of Britain, and penning the Proclamation to all true
subjects and adherents of the legitimate Government.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘I thought,’ said A——, turning short round upon B——, ‘that
you of the Lake School did not like Pope?’—‘Not like Pope!
My dear sir, you must be under a mistake—I can read him over and
over for ever!’—‘Why certainly, the “Essay on Man” must be
masterpiece.’—‘It may be so, but I seldom look into it.’—‘Oh!
then it’s his Satires you admire?’—‘No, not his Satires, but his
friendly Epistles and his compliments.’—‘Compliments! I did not
know he ever made any.’—‘The finest,’ said B——, ‘that were
ever paid by the wit of man. Each of them is worth an estate for
life—nay, is an immortality. There is that superb one to Lord
Cornbury:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Despise low joys, low gains;</div>

      <div class='line'>Be virtuous, and be happy for your pains.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>‘Was there ever more artful insinuation of idolatrous praise? And
then that noble apotheosis of his friend Lord Mansfield (however
little deserved), when, speaking of the House of Lords, he adds—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Conspicuous scene! another yet is nigh,</div>

      <div class='line'>Where Murray (long enough his country’s pride)</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall be no more than Tully or than Hyde!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>‘And with what a fine turn of indignant flattery he addresses Lord
Bolingbroke—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why rail they then, if but one wreath of mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! all accomplish’d St. John, deck thy shrine?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>‘Or turn,’ continued B——, with a slight hectic on his cheek and his
eye glistening, ‘to his list of early friends:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But why then publish? Granville the polite,</div>
      <div class='line'>And knowing Walsh, would tell me I could write;</div>
      <div class='line'>Well-natured Garth inflamed with early praise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Congreve loved and Swift endured my lays:</div>
      <div class='line'>The courtly Talbot, Somers, Sheffield read,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ev’n mitred Rochester would nod the head;</div>
      <div class='line'>And St. John’s self (great Dryden’s friend before)</div>
      <div class='line'>Received with open arms one poet more.</div>
      <div class='line'>Happy my studies, if by these approved!</div>
      <div class='line'>Happier their author, if by these beloved!</div>
      <div class='line'>From these the world will judge of men and books,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not from the Burnets, Oldmixons, and Cooks.”’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Here his voice totally failed him, and throwing down the book, he
said, ‘Do you think I would not wish to have been friends with such
a man as this?’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘What say you to Dryden?’—‘He rather made a show of himself,
and courted popularity in that lowest temple of Fame, a
coffee-house, so as in some measure to vulgarize one’s idea of him.
Pope, on the contrary, reached the very <em>beau-ideal</em> of what a poet’s
life should be; and his fame while living seemed to be an emanation
from that which was to circle his name after death. He was so far
enviable (and one would feel proud to have witnessed the rare spectacle
in him) that he was almost the only poet and man of genius who
met with his reward on this side of the tomb, who realized in friends,
fortune, the esteem of the world, the most sanguine hopes of a
youthful ambition, and who found that sort of patronage from the
great during his lifetime which they would be thought anxious to
bestow upon him after his death. Read Gay’s verses to him on his
supposed return from Greece, after his translation of Homer was
finished, and say if you would not gladly join the bright procession
that welcomed him home, or see it once more land at Whitehall-stairs.’—‘Still,’
said Miss D——, ‘I would rather have seen him
talking with Patty Blount, or riding by in a coronet-coach with
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu!’</p>

<p class='c007'>E——, who was deep in a game of piquet at the other end of the
room, whispered to M. C. to ask if Junius would not be a fit person
to invoke from the dead. ‘Yes,’ said B——, ‘provided he would
agree to lay aside his mask.’</p>

<p class='c007'>We were now at a stand for a short time, when Fielding was
mentioned as a candidate: only one, however, seconded the proposition.
‘Richardson?’—‘By all means, but only to look at him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>through the glass-door of his back-shop, hard at work upon one of his
novels (the most extraordinary contrast that ever was presented
between an author and his works), but not to let him come behind his
counter lest he should want you to turn customer, nor to go upstairs
with him, lest he should offer to read the first manuscript of Sir
Charles Grandison, which was originally written in eight and twenty
volumes octavo, or get out the letters of his female correspondents, to
prove that Joseph Andrews was low.’</p>

<p class='c007'>There was but one statesman in the whole of English history that
any one expressed the least desire to see—Oliver Cromwell, with his
fine, frank, rough, pimply face, and wily policy;—and one enthusiast,
John Bunyan, the immortal author of the Pilgrim’s Progress. It
seemed that if he came into the room, dreams would follow him, and
that each person would nod under his golden cloud, ‘nigh-sphered in
Heaven,’ a canopy as strange and stately as any in Homer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all persons near our own time, Garrick’s name was received
with the greatest enthusiasm, who was proposed by J. F——. He
presently superseded both Hogarth and Handel, who had been talked
of, but then it was on condition that he should act in tragedy and
comedy, in the play and the farce, Lear and Wildair and Abel
Drugger. What a <em>sight for sore eyes</em> that would be! Who would
not part with a year’s income at least, almost with a year of his
natural life, to be present at it? Besides, as he could not act alone,
and recitations are unsatisfactory things, what a troop he must bring
with him—the silver-tongued Barry, and Quin, and Shuter and
Weston, and Mrs. Clive and Mrs. Pritchard, of whom I have heard
my father speak as so great a favourite when he was young! This
would indeed be a revival of the dead, the restoring of art; and so
much the more desirable, as such is the lurking scepticism mingled
with our overstrained admiration of past excellence, that though we
have the speeches of Burke, the portraits of Reynolds, the writings of
Goldsmith, and the conversation of Johnson, to show what people
could do at that period, and to confirm the universal testimony to the
merits of Garrick; yet, as it was before our time, we have our
misgivings, as if he was probably after all little better than a Bartlemy-fair
actor, dressed out to play Macbeth in a scarlet coat and laced
cocked-hat. For one, I should like to have seen and heard with
my own eyes and ears. Certainly, by all accounts, if any one was
ever moved by the true histrionic <em>æstus</em>, it was Garrick. When he
followed the Ghost in Hamlet, he did not drop the sword, as most
actors do behind the scenes, but kept the point raised the whole way
round, so fully was he possessed with the idea, or so anxious not to
lose sight of his part for a moment. Once at a splendid dinner-party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>at Lord ——’s, they suddenly missed Garrick, and could not imagine
what was become of him, till they were drawn to the window by the
convulsive screams and peals of laughter of a young negro boy, who
was rolling on the ground in an ecstasy of delight to see Garrick
mimicking a turkey-cock in the court-yard, with his coat-tail stuck out
behind, and in a seeming flutter of feathered rage and pride. Of our
party only two persons present had seen the British Roscius; and
they seemed as willing as the rest to renew their acquaintance with
their old favourite.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were interrupted in the hey-day and mid-career of this fanciful
speculation, by a grumbler in a corner, who declared it was a shame
to make all this rout about a mere player and farce-writer, to the
neglect and exclusion of the fine old dramatists, the contemporaries
and rivals of Shakspeare. B—— said he had anticipated this
objection when he had named the author of Mustapha and Alaham;
and out of caprice insisted upon keeping him to represent the set, in
preference to the wild hair-brained enthusiast Kit Marlowe; to the
sexton of St. Ann’s, Webster, with his melancholy yew-trees and
death’s-heads; to Deckar, who was but a garrulous proser; to the
voluminous Heywood; and even to Beaumont and Fletcher, whom
we might offend by complimenting the wrong author on their joint
productions. Lord Brook, on the contrary, stood quite by himself,
or in Cowley’s words, was ‘a vast species alone.’ Some one hinted
at the circumstance of his being a lord, which rather startled B——,
but he said a <em>ghost</em> would perhaps dispense with strict etiquette, on
being regularly addressed by his title. Ben Jonson divided our
suffrages pretty equally. Some were afraid he would begin to traduce
Shakspeare, who was not present to defend himself. ‘If he grows
disagreeable,’ it was whispered aloud, ‘there is G—— can match
him.’ At length, his romantic visit to Drummond of Hawthornden
was mentioned, and turned the scale in his favour.</p>

<p class='c007'>B—— inquired if there was any one that was hanged that I would
choose to mention? And I answered, Eugene Aram.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a> The name
of the ‘Admirable Crichton’ was suddenly started as a splendid
example of <em>waste</em> talents, so different from the generality of his
countrymen. This choice was mightily approved by a North-Briton
present, who declared himself descended from that prodigy of learning
and accomplishment, and said he had family-plate in his possession as
vouchers for the fact, with the initials A. C.—<em>Admirable Crichton</em>!
H—— laughed or rather roared as heartily at this as I should think
he has done for many years.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>The last-named Mitre-courtier<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a> then wished to know whether there
were any metaphysicians to whom one might be tempted to apply the
wizard spell? I replied, there were only six in modern times
deserving the name—Hobbes, Berkeley, Butler, Hartley, Hume,
Leibnitz; and perhaps Jonathan Edwards, a Massachusets man.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
As to the French, who talked fluently of having <em>created</em> this science,
there was not a title in any of their writings, that was not to be found
literally in the authors I had mentioned. [Horne Tooke, who
might have a claim to come in under the head of Grammar, was still
living.] None of these names seemed to excite much interest, and I
did not plead for the re-appearance of those who might be thought
best fitted by the abstracted nature of their studies for their present
spiritual and disembodied state, and who, even while on this living
stage, were nearly divested of common flesh and blood. As A——
with an uneasy fidgetty face was about to put some question about
Mr. Locke and Dugald Stewart, he was prevented by M. C. who
observed, ‘If J—— was here, he would undoubtedly be for having
up those profound and redoubted scholiasts, Thomas Aquinas and
Duns Scotus.’ I said this might be fair enough in him who had
read or fancied he had read the original works, but I did not see
how we could have any right to call up these authors to give an
account of themselves in person, till we had looked into their
writings.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time it should seem that some rumour of our whimsical
deliberation had got wind, and had disturbed the <em>irritabile genus</em> in
their shadowy abodes, for we received messages from several candidates
that we had just been thinking of. Gray declined our invitation,
though he had not yet been asked: Gay offered to come and bring
in his hand the Duchess of Bolton, the original Polly: Steele and
Addison left their cards as Captain Sentry and Sir Roger de Coverley:
Swift came in and sat down without speaking a word, and quitted the
room as abruptly: Otway and Chatterton were seen lingering on the
opposite side of the Styx, but could not muster enough between them
to pay Charon his fare: Thomson fell asleep in the boat, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>rowed back again—and Burns sent a low fellow, one John Barleycorn,
an old companion of his who had conducted him to the other world,
to say that he had during his lifetime been drawn out of his retirement
as a show, only to be made an exciseman of, and that he would rather
remain where he was. He desired, however, to shake hands by his
representative—the hand, thus held out, was in a burning fever, and
shook prodigiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>The room was hung round with several portraits of eminent
painters. While we were debating whether we should demand speech
with these masters of mute eloquence, whose features were so familiar
to us, it seemed that all at once they glided from their frames, and
seated themselves at some little distance from us. There was
Leonardo with his majestic beard and watchful eye, having a bust of
Archimedes before him; next him was Raphael’s graceful head
turned round to the Fornarina; and on his other side was Lucretia
Borgia, with calm, golden locks; Michael Angelo had placed the
model of St. Peter’s on the table before him; Corregio had an angel
at his side; Titian was seated with his Mistress between himself and
Giorgioni; Guido was accompanied by his own Aurora, who took a
dice-box from him; Claude held a mirror in his hand; Rubens
patted a beautiful panther (led in by a satyr) on the head; Vandyke
appeared as his own Paris, and Rembrandt was hid under furs, gold
chains and jewels, which Sir Joshua eyed closely, holding his hand
so as to shade his forehead. Not a word was spoken; and as we
rose to do them homage, they still presented the same surface to the
view. Not being <i><span lang="la">bonâ-fide</span></i> representations of living people, we got rid
of the splendid apparitions by signs and dumb show. As soon as
they had melted into thin air, there was a loud noise at the outer
door, and we found it was Giotto, Cimabue, and Ghirlandaio, who
had been raised from the dead by their earnest desire to see their
illustrious successors—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Finding them gone, they had no ambition to be seen after them, and
mournfully withdrew. ‘Egad!’ said B——, ‘those are the very
fellows I should like to have had some talk with, to know how they
could see to paint when all was dark around them?’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘But shall we have nothing to say,’ interrogated G. J——, ‘to
the Legend of Good Women?’—‘Name, name, Mr. J——,’ cried
H—— in a boisterous tone of friendly exultation, ‘name as many as
you please, without reserve or fear of molestation!’ J—— was
perplexed between so many amiable recollections, that the name of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>lady of his choice expired in a pensive whiff of his pipe; and B——
impatiently declared for the Duchess of Newcastle. Mrs. Hutchinson
was no sooner mentioned, than she carried the day from the
Duchess. We were the less solicitous on this subject of filling up
the posthumous lists of Good Women, as there was already one in
the room as good, as sensible, and in all respects as exemplary, as the
best of them could be for their lives! ‘I should like vastly to have
seen Ninon de l’Enclos,’ said that incomparable person; and this
immediately put us in mind that we had neglected to pay honour due
to our friends on the other side of the Channel: Voltaire, the patriarch
of levity, and Rousseau, the father of sentiment, Montaigne and
Rabelais (great in wisdom and in wit), Moliere and that illustrious
group that are collected round him (in the print of that subject) to
hear him read his comedy of the Tartuffe at the house of Ninon;
Racine, La Fontaine, Rochefoucault, St. Evremont, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘There is one person,’ said a shrill, querulous voice, ‘I would
rather see than all these—Don Quixote!’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Come, come!’ said H——; ‘I thought we should have no
heroes, real or fabulous. What say you, Mr. B——? Are you for
eking out your shadowy list with such names as Alexander, Julius
Cæsar, Tamerlane, or Ghengis Khan?’—‘Excuse me,’ said B——,
‘on the subject of characters in active life, plotters and disturbers of
the world, I have a crotchet of my own, which I beg leave to reserve.’—‘No,
no! come, out with your worthies!’—‘What do you think
of Guy Faux and Judas Iscariot?’ H—— turned an eye upon him
like a wild Indian, but cordial and full of smothered glee. ‘Your
most exquisite reason!’ was echoed on all sides; and A——
thought that B—— had now fairly entangled himself. ‘Why, I
cannot but think,’ retorted he of the wistful countenance, ‘that Guy
Faux, that poor fluttering annual scare-crow of straw and rags, is an
ill-used gentleman. I would give something to see him sitting pale
and emaciated, surrounded by his matches and his barrels of gunpowder,
and expecting the moment that was to transport him to
Paradise for his heroic self-devotion; but if I say any more, there is
that fellow G—— will make something of it. And as to Judas
Iscariot, my reason is different. I would fain see the face of him,
who, having dipped his hand in the same dish with the Son of Man,
could afterwards betray him. I have no conception of such a thing;
nor have I ever seen any picture (not even Leonardo’s very fine one)
that gave me the least idea of it.’—‘You have said enough,
Mr. B——, to justify your choice.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Oh! ever right, Menenius,—ever right!’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘There is only one other person I can ever think of after this,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>continued H——; but without mentioning a name that once put on
a semblance of mortality. ‘If Shakspeare was to come into the
room, we should all rise up to meet him; but if that person was to
come into it, we should all fall down and try to kiss the hem of his
garment!’</p>

<p class='c007'>As a lady present seemed now to get uneasy at the turn the
conversation had taken, we rose up to go. The morning broke with
that dim, dubious light by which Giotto, Cimabue, and Ghirlandaio
must have seen to paint their earliest works; and we parted to meet
again and renew similar topics at night, the next night, and the night
after that, till that night overspread Europe which saw no dawn.
The same event, in truth, broke up our little Congress that broke up
the great one. But that was to meet again: our deliberations have
never been resumed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The conversation of Lords is very different from that of authors.
Mounted on horseback, they stick at nothing in the chace, and clear
every obstacle with flying leaps, while we poor devils have no chance
of keeping up with them with our clouten shoes and long hunting-poles.
They have all the benefit of education, society, confidence,
they read books, purchase pictures, breed horses, learn to ride, dance,
and fence, look after their estates, travel abroad:—authors have none
of these advantages, or inlets of knowledge, to assist them, except
one, reading; and this is still more impoverished and clouded by the
painful exercise of their own thoughts. The knowledge of the
Great has a character of wealth and property in it, like the stores of
the rich merchant or manufacturer, who lays his hands on all within
his reach: the understanding of the student is like the workshop of
the mechanic, who has nothing but what he himself creates. How
difficult is the production, how small the display in the one case compared
to the other! Most of Correggio’s designs are contained in
one small room at Parma: how different from the extent and variety
of some hereditary and princely collections!</p>

<p class='c007'>The human mind has a trick (probably a very natural and consoling
one) of striking a balance between the favours of wisdom and of
fortune, and of making one thing a gratuitous and convenient foil to
another. Whether this is owing to envy or to a love of justice, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>will not say: but whichever it is owing to, I must own I do not
think it well founded. A scholar is without money: therefore (to
make the odds even) we argue (not very wisely) that a rich man
must be without ideas. This does not follow. ‘The wish is father
to that thought;’ and the thought is a spurious one. We might as
well pretend, that because a man has the advantage of us in height,
he is not strong or in good health; or because a woman is handsome,
she is not at the same time young, accomplished and well-bred. Our
fastidious self-love or our rustic prejudices may revolt at the accumulation
of advantages in others; but we must learn to submit to the
mortifying truth, which every day’s experience points out, with what
grace we may. There were those who grudged to Lord Byron the
name of a poet because he was of noble birth; as he himself could
not endure the praises bestowed upon Wordsworth, whom he considered
as a clown. He carried this weakness so far, that he even
seemed to regard it as a piece of presumption in Shakspeare <em>to be
preferred before him</em> as a dramatic author, and contended that Milton’s
writing an epic poem and the ‘Answer to Salmasius’ was entirely
owing to vanity—so little did he relish the superiority of the old
blind schoolmaster. So it is that one party would arrogate every
advantage to themselves, while those on the other side would detract
from all in their rivals that they do not themselves possess. Some
will not have the statue painted: others can see no beauty in the
clay-model!</p>

<p class='c007'>The man of rank and fortune, besides his chance for the common
or (now and then) an uncommon share of wit and understanding, has
it in his power to avail himself of every thing that is to be taught of
art and science; he has tutors and valets at his beck; he may master
the dead languages, he <em>must</em> acquire the modern ones; he moves in
the highest circles, and may descend to the lowest; the paths of
pleasure, of ambition, of knowledge, are open to him; he may devote
himself to a particular study, or skim the cream of all; he may read
books or men or things, as he finds most convenient or agreeable; he
is not forced to confine his attention to some one dry uninteresting
pursuit; he has a single <em>hobby</em>, or half a dozen; he is not distracted
by care, by poverty and want of leisure; he has every opportunity
and facility afforded him for acquiring various accomplishments of
body or mind, and every encouragement, from confidence and success,
for making an imposing display of them; he may laugh with the
gay, jest with the witty, argue with the wise; he has been in courts,
in colleges, and camps, is familiar with playhouses and taverns, with
the riding-house and the dissecting-room, has been present at or taken
part in the debates of both Houses of Parliament, was in the O. P.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>row, and is deep in the Fancy, understands the broadsword exercise,
is a connoisseur in regimentals, plays the whole game at whist, is a
tolerable proficient at backgammon, drives four in hand, skates, rows,
swims, shoots; knows the different sorts of game and modes of
agriculture in the different counties of England, the manufactures and
commerce of the different towns, the politics of Europe, the campaigns
in Spain, has the Gazette, the newspapers, and reviews at his
fingers’ ends, has visited the finest scenes of Nature and beheld
the choicest works of Art, and is in society where he is continually
hearing or talking of all these things; and yet we are surprised to
find that a person so circumstanced and qualified has any ideas to
communicate or words to express himself, and is not, as by patent
and prescription he was bound to be, a mere well-dressed fop of
fashion or a booby lord! It would be less remarkable if a poor
author, who has none of this giddy range and scope of information,
who pores over the page till it fades from his sight, and refines upon
his style till the words stick in his throat, should be dull as a beetle
and mute as a fish, instead of spontaneously pouring out a volume of
wit and wisdom on every subject that can be started.</p>

<p class='c007'>An author lives out of the world, or mixes chiefly with those of
his own class; which renders him pedantic and pragmatical, or gives
him a reserved, hesitating, and <em>interdicted</em> manner. A lord or gentleman-commoner
goes into the world, and this imparts that fluency,
spirit, and freshness to his conversation, which arises from the circulation
of ideas and from the greater animation and excitement of
unrestrained intercourse. An author’s tongue is tied for want of
somebody to speak to: his ideas rust and become obscured, from not
being brought out in company and exposed to the gaze of instant
admiration. A lord has always some one at hand on whom he can
‘bestow his tediousness,’ and grows voluble, copious, inexhaustible
in consequence: his wit is polished, and the flowers of his oratory
expanded by his smiling commerce with the world, like the figures
in tapestry, that after being thrust into a corner and folded up in
closets, are displayed on festival and gala-days. Again, the man of
fashion and fortune reduces many of those arts and mysteries to
practice, of which the scholar gains all his knowledge from books
and vague description. Will not the rules of architecture find a
readier reception and sink deeper into the mind of the proprietor of
a noble mansion, or of him who means to build one, than of the half-starved
occupier of a garret? Will not the political economist’s
insight into Mr. Ricardo’s doctrine of Rent, or Mr. Malthus’s
theory of Population, be vastly quickened by the circumstance of his
possessing a large landed estate and having to pay enormous poor-rates?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>And in general is it not self-evident that a man’s knowledge
of the true interests of the country will be enlarged just in proportion
to the <em>stake</em> he has in it? A person may have read accounts of
different cities and the customs of different nations: but will this give
him the same accurate idea of the situation of celebrated places, of
the aspect and manners of the inhabitants, or the same lively impulse
and ardour and fund of striking particulars in expatiating upon them,
as if he had run over half the countries of Europe, for no other
purpose than to satisfy his own curiosity, and excite that of others
on his return? I many years ago looked into the Duke of Newcastle’s
‘Treatise on Horsemanship’; all I remember of it is some
quaint cuts of the Duke and his riding-master introduced to illustrate
the lessons. Had I myself possessed a stud of Arabian coursers,
with grooms and a master of the horse to assist me in reducing
these precepts to practice, they would have made a stronger impression
on my mind; and what interested myself from vanity or habit,
I could have made interesting to others. I am sure I could have
learnt to <em>ride the Great Horse</em>, and do twenty other things, in the
time I have employed in endeavouring to make something out of
nothing, or in conning the same problem fifty times over, as monks
count over their beads! I have occasionally in my life bought a few
prints, and hung them up in my room with great satisfaction; but is
it to be supposed possible, from this casual circumstance, that I should
compete in taste or in the knowledge of <em>virtù</em> with a peer of the
realm, who has in his possession the costly designs, or a wealthy
commoner, who has spent half his fortune in learning to distinguish
copies from originals? ‘A question not to be asked!’ Nor is it
likely that the having dipped into the Memoirs of Count Grammont,
or of Lady Vane in Peregrine Pickle, should enable any one to
sustain a conversation on subjects of love and gallantry with the same
ease, grace, brilliancy, and spirit as the having been engaged in a
hundred adventures of one’s own, or heard the scandal and tittle-tattle
of fashionable life for the last thirty years canvassed a hundred
times. Books may be manufactured from other books by some dull,
mechanical process: it is conversation and the access to the best
society that alone fit us for society; or ‘the act and practic part of
life must be the mistress to our theorique,’ before we can hope to
shine in mixed company, or bend our previous knowledge to ordinary
and familiar uses out of that plaster-cast mould which is as brittle as
it is formal!</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another thing which tends to produce the same effect,
viz. that lords and gentlemen seldom trouble themselves about the
knotty and uninviting parts of a subject: they leave it to ‘the dregs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of earth’ to drain the cup or find the bottom. They are attracted
by the frothy and sparkling. If a question puzzles them, or is not
likely to amuse others, they leave it to its fate, or to those whose
business it is to contend with difficulty, and to pursue truth for its
own sake. They string together as many available, <em>off-hand</em> topics
as they can procure for love or money; and aided by a good person
or address, sport them with very considerable effect at the next rout
or party they go to. They do not <em>bore</em> you with pedantry, or tease
you with sophistry. Their conversation is not made up of <em>moot-points</em>
or <em>choke-pears</em>. They do not willingly forego ‘the feast of reason
or the flow of soul’ to grub up some solitary truth or dig for hid
treasure. They are amateurs, not professors; the patrons, not the
drudges of knowledge. An author loses half his life, and <em>stultifies</em>
his faculties, in hopes to find out something which perhaps neither he
nor any one else can ever find out. For this he neglects half a
hundred acquirements, half a hundred accomplishments. <em>Aut Cæsar
aut nihil.</em> He is proud of the discovery or of the fond pursuit of one
truth—a lord is vain of a thousand ostentatious common-places. If
the latter ever devotes himself to some crabbed study, or sets about
finding out the longitude, he is then to be looked upon as a humorist
if he fails—a genius if he succeeds—and no longer belongs to the
class I have been speaking of.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps a multiplicity of attainments and pursuits is not very
favourable to their selectness; as a local and personal acquaintance
with objects of imagination takes away from, instead of adding to,
their romantic interest. Familiarity is said to breed contempt; or
at any rate, the being brought into contact with places, persons, or
things that we have hitherto only heard or read of, removes a certain
aerial delicious veil of refinement from them, and strikes at that <em>ideal</em>
abstraction, which is the charm and boast of a life conversant chiefly
among books. The huddling a number of tastes and studies together
tends to degrade and vulgarise each, and to give a crude, unconcocted,
dissipated turn to the mind. Instead of stuffing it full of gross,
palpable, immediate objects of excitement, a wiser plan would be to
leave something in reserve, something hovering in airy space to draw
our attention out of ourselves, to excite hope, curiosity, wonder, and
never to satisfy it. The great art is not to throw a glare of light
upon all objects, or to lay the whole extended landscape bare at one
view; but so to manage as to see the more amiable side of things, and
through the narrow vistas and loop-holes of retreat,</p>

<p class='c007'>I hate to annihilate air and distance by the perpetual use of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>opera-glass, to run every thing into foreground, and to interpose no
medium between the thought and the object. The breath of words
stirs and plays idly with the gossamer web of fancy: the touch of
things destroys it. I have seen a good deal of authors: and I believe
that they (as well as I) would quite as lieve that I had not. Places
I have seen too, that did not answer my expectation. Pictures (that
is, some few of them) are the only things that are the better for our
having studied them ‘face to face, not in a glass darkly,’ and that in
themselves surpass any description we can give, or any notion we can
form of them. But I do not think seriously, after all, that those who
possess are the best judges of them. They become furniture, property
in their hands. The purchasers look to the price they will
fetch, or turn to that which they have cost. They consider not
beauty or expression, but the workmanship, the date, the pedigree,
the school—something that will figure in the description in a catalogue
or in a puff in a newspaper. They are blinded by silly admiration of
whatever belongs to themselves, and warped so as to eye ‘with jealous
leer malign’ all that is not theirs. Taste is melted down in the
crucible of avarice and vanity, and leaves a wretched <i><span lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i>
of pedantry and conceit. As to books, they ‘best can feel them who
have read them most,’ and who rely on them for their only support
and their only chance of distinction. They most keenly relish the
graces of style who have in vain tried to make them their own: they
alone understand the value of a thought who have gone through the
trouble of thinking. The privation of other advantages is not a clear
loss, if it is counterbalanced by a proportionable concentration and
unity of interest in what is left. The love of letters is the forlorn
hope of the man of letters. His ruling passion is the love of fame.
A member of the Roxburgh Club has a certain work (let it be the
Decameron of Boccaccio) splendidly bound, and in the old quarto
edition, we will say. In this not only his literary taste is gratified,
but the pride of property, the love of external elegance and decoration.
The poor student has only a paltry and somewhat worn copy
of the same work (or perhaps only a translation) which he picked up
at a stall, standing out of a shower of rain. What then! has not the
Noble Virtuoso doubly the advantage, and a much higher pleasure in
the perusal of the work? No; for these are vulgar and mechanical
helps to the true enjoyment of letters. From all this mock-display
and idle parade of binding and arms and dates, his unthought-of rival
is precluded, and sees only the talismanic words, feels only the spirit
of the author, and in that author reads ‘with sparkling eyes’</p>

<p class='c007'>We are far at present from the style of Swift’s ‘Polite Conversation.’
The fashionable tone has quite changed in this respect, and
almost gone into the opposite extreme. At that period, the polite
world seems to have been nearly at a stand, in a state of intellectual
<em>abeyance</em>; or in the interval between the disuse of chivalrous exercises
and the introduction of modern philosophy, not to have known how
to pass its time and to have sunk into the most common-place formality
and unmeaning apathy. But lo! at a signal given, or rather prompted
by that most powerful of all calls, the want of something to do, all
rush into the lists, having armed themselves anew with the shining
panoply of science and of letters, with an eagerness, a perseverance,
a dexterity, and a success that are truly astonishing. The higher
classes have of late taken the lead almost as much in arts as they
formerly did in arms, when the last was the only prescribed mode of
distinguishing themselves from the rabble whom they treated as serfs
and churls. The prevailing cue at present is to regard mere authors
(who are not also of gentle blood) as dull, illiterate, poor creatures,
a sort of pretenders to taste and elegance, and adventurers in intellect.
The true adepts in black-letter are knights of the shire: the sworn
patentees of Parnassus are Peers of the Realm. Not to pass for a
literary quack, you must procure a diploma from the College of
Heralds. A dandy conceals a bibliomanist: our belles are <em>bluestockings</em>.
The Press is so entirely monopolised by beauty, birth, or
importance in the State, that an author by profession resigns the field
to the crowd of well-dressed competitors, out of modesty or pride, is
fain to keep out of sight—</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Byron used to boast that he could bring forward a dozen young
men of fashion who could beat all the regular authors at their several
weapons of wit or argument; and though I demur to the truth of the
assertion, yet there is no saying till the thing is tried. Young gentlemen
make <em>very pretty sparrers</em>, but are not the ‘ugliest customers’
when they take off the gloves. Lord Byron himself was in his
capacity of author an <em>out-and-outer</em>; but then it was at the expense of
other things, for he could not talk except in short sentences and
sarcastic allusions, he had no ready resources; all his ideas moulded
themselves into stanzas, and all his ardour was carried off in rhyme.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>The channel of his pen was worn deep by habit and power; the
current of his thoughts flowed strong in it, and nothing remained to
supply the neighbouring flats and shallows of miscellaneous conversation,
but a few sprinklings of wit or gushes of spleen. An intense
purpose concentrated and gave a determined direction to his energies,
that ‘held on their way, unslacked of motion.’ The track of his
genius was like a volcanic eruption, a torrent of burning lava, full of
heat and splendour and headlong fury, that left all dry, cold, hard,
and barren behind it! To say nothing of a host of female authors, a
bright galaxy above our heads, there is no young lady of fashion in
the present day, scarce a boarding-school girl, that is not mistress of
as many branches of knowledge as would set up half-a-dozen literary
hacks. In lieu of the sampler and the plain-stitch of our grandmothers,
they have so many hours for French, so many for Italian,
so many for English grammar and composition, so many for geography
and the use of the globes, so many for history, so many for
botany, so many for painting, music, dancing, riding, &#38;c. One
almost wonders how so many studies are crammed into the twenty-four
hours; or how such fair and delicate creatures can master them
without spoiling the smoothness of their brows, the sweetness of their
tempers, or the graceful simplicity of their manners. A girl learns
French (not only to read, but to speak it) in a few months, while
a boy is as many years in learning to construe Latin. Why so?
Chiefly because the one is treated as a <em>bagatelle</em> or agreeable relaxation;
the other as a serious task or necessary evil. Education, a
very few years back, was looked upon as a hardship, and enforced by
menaces and blows, instead of being carried on (as now) as an amusement
and under the garb of pleasure, and with the allurements of
self-love. It is found that the products of the mind flourish better
and shoot up more quickly in the sunshine of good-humour and in the
air of freedom, than under the frowns of sullenness, or the shackles
of authority. ‘The labour we delight in physics pain.’ The idlest
people are not those who have most leisure-time to dispose of as they
choose: take away the feeling of compulsion, and you supply a motive
for application, by converting a toil into a pleasure. This makes
nearly all the difference between the hardest drudgery and the most
delightful exercise—not the degree of exertion, but the motive and
the accompanying sensation. Learning does not gain proselytes by
the austerity or awfulness of its looks. By representing things as so
difficult, and as exacting such dreadful sacrifices, and to be acquired
under such severe penalties, we not only deter the student from the
attempt, but lay a dead-weight upon the imagination, and destroy that
cheerfulness and alacrity of spirit which is the spring of thought and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>action. But to return.—An author by profession reads a few works
that he intends to criticise and cut up ‘for a consideration,’—a <em>bluestocking</em>
by profession reads all that comes out to pass the time or
satisfy her curiosity. The author has something to say about Fielding,
Richardson, or even the Scotch novels: but he is soon distanced by
the fair critic or overwhelmed with the contents of whole Circulating
Libraries poured out upon his head without stint or intermission.
He reads for an object and to live; she for the sake of reading or to
talk. Be this as it may, the idle reader at present reads twenty times
as many books as the learned one. The former skims the surface of
knowledge, and carries away the striking points and a variety of
amusing details, while the latter reserves himself for great occasions,
or perhaps does nothing under the pretence of having so much to do.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <em>literati</em> of Europe threaten at present to become the Monks of
letters, and from having taken up learning as a profession, to live on
the reputation of it. As gentlemen have turned authors, authors
seem inclined to turn gentlemen; and enjoying the <em>otium cum dignitate</em>,
to be much too refined and abstracted to condescend to the subordinate
or mechanical parts of knowledge. They are too wise in
general to be acquainted with anything in particular; and remain in
a proud and listless ignorance of all that is within the reach of the
vulgar. They are not, as of old, walking libraries or Encyclopædias,
but rather certain faculties of the mind personified. They scorn the
material and instrumental branches of inquiry, the husk and bran, and
affect only the fine flour of literature—they are only to be called in
to give the last polish to style, the last refinement to thought. They
leave it to their drudges, the Reading Public, to accumulate the facts,
to arrange the evidence, to make out the <em>data</em>, and like great painters
whose pupils have got in the ground-work and the established proportions
of a picture, come forward to go over the last thin glazing of
the colours, or throw in the finer touches of expression. On my
excusing myself to N—— for some blunder in history, by saying,
‘I really had not time to read,’—he said, ‘No, but you have time to
write!’ And once a celebrated critic taking me to task as to the
subject of my pursuits, and receiving regularly the same answer to his
queries, that I knew nothing of chemistry, nothing of astronomy,
of botany, of law, of politics, &#38;c. at last exclaimed somewhat impatiently—‘What
the devil is it, then, you <em>do</em> know?’ I laughed,
and was not very much disconcerted at the reproof, as it was just.</p>

<p class='c007'>Modern men of letters may be divided into three classes; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>mere scholar or <em>book-worm</em>, all whose knowledge is taken from books,
and who may be passed by as an obsolete character, little inquired
after—the literary <em>hack</em> or coffee-house politician, who gets his information
mostly from hearsay, and who makes some noise indeed,
but the echo of it does not reach beyond his own club or circle—and
the man of real or of pretended genius, who aims to draw upon his
own resources of thought or feeling, and to throw a new light upon
nature and books. This last personage (if he acts up to his supposed
character) has too much to do to lend himself to a variety of pursuits,
or to lay himself out to please in all companies. He has a task in
hand, a vow to perform; and he cannot be diverted from it by
incidental or collateral objects. All the time that he does not devote
to this paramount duty, he should have to himself, to repose, to lie
fallow, to gather strength and recruit himself. A boxer is led into
the lists that he may not waste a particle of vigour needlessly; and a
leader in Parliament, on the day that he is expected to get up a grand
attack or defence, is not to be pestered with the ordinary news of the
day. So an author (who is, or would be thought original) has no
time for <em>spare</em> accomplishments or ornamental studies. All that he
intermeddles with must be marshalled to bear upon his purpose. He
must be acquainted with books and the thoughts of others, but
only so far as to assist him on his way, and ‘to take progression from
them.’ He starts from the point where <em>they</em> left off. All that does
not aid him in his new career goes for nothing, is thrown out of the
account; or is a useless and splendid incumbrance. Most of his
time he passes in brooding over some wayward hint or suggestion of
a thought, nor is he bound to give any explanation of what he does
with the rest. He tries to melt down truth into essences—to express
some fine train of feeling, to solve some difficult problem, to start
what is new, or to perfect what is old; in a word, not to do what
others can do (which in the division of mental labour he holds to be
unnecessary), but to do what they all with their joint efforts cannot
do. For this he is in no hurry, and must have the disposal of his
leisure and the choice of his subject. The public can wait. He
deems with a living poet, who is an example of his own doctrine—</p>

<p class='c013'>The aspiring poet or prose-writer undertakes to do a certain thing;
and if he succeeds, it is enough. While he is intent upon that or
asleep, others may amuse themselves how they can with any topic
that happens to be afloat and all the eloquence they are masters of,
so that they do not disturb the champion of truth, or the proclaimer
of beauty to the world. The Conversation of Lords, on the contrary,
is to this like a newspaper to a book—the latter treats well or
ill of one subject, and leads to a conclusion on one point; the other
is made up of all sorts of things jumbled together, debates in parliament,
law-reports, plays, operas, concerts, routs, levees, fashions,
auctions, the last fight, foreign news, deaths, marriages, and <em>crim-cons</em>,
bankruptcies, and quack medicines; and a large allowance is frequently
to be made, besides the natural confusion of the subjects, for <em>cross-readings</em>
in the speaker’s mind!<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Or, to take another illustration,
fashionable conversation has something theatrical or <em>melo-dramatic</em> in
it; it is got up for immediate effect, it is calculated to make a great
display, there is a profusion of paint, scenery, and dresses, the music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>is loud, there are banquets and processions, you have the dancers from
the Opera, the horses from Astley’s, and the elephant from Exeter
‘Change, the stage is all life, bustle, noise and glare, the audience
brilliant and delighted, and the whole goes off in a blaze of phosphorus;
but the dialogue is poor, the story improbable, the critics
shake their heads in the pit, and the next day the piece is <em>damned</em>!</p>

<p class='c007'>In short, a man of rank and fortune takes the adventitious and
ornamental part of letters, the obvious, popular, fashionable, that
serves to amuse at the time, or minister to the cravings of vanity,
without laying a very heavy tax on his own understanding, or the
patience of his hearers. He furnishes his mind as he does his house,
with what is showy, striking, and of the newest pattern: he mounts
his <em>hobby</em> as he does his horse, which is brought to his door for an
airing, and which (should it prove restive or sluggish) he turns away
for another; or like a child at a fair, gets into a round-about of knowledge,
till his head becomes giddy, runs from sight to sight, from
booth to booth, and like the child, goes home loaded with trinkets,
gewgaws, and rattles. He does not pore and pine over an idea (like
some poor hypochondriac) till it becomes impracticable, unsociable,
incommunicable, absorbed in mysticism, and lost in minuteness: he
is not upon oath never to utter anything but oracles, but rattles away
in a fine careless hair-brained dashing manner, hit or miss, and succeeds
the better for it. Nor does he prose over the same stale round of
politics and the state of the nation (with the coffee-house politician),
but launches out with freedom and gaiety into whatever has attraction
and interest in it, ‘runs the great circle, and is still at home.’ He is
inquisitive, garrulous, credulous, sanguine, florid,—neither pedantic
nor vulgar. Neither is he intolerant, exclusive, bigoted to one set of
opinions or one class of individuals. He clothes an abstract theory
with illustrations from his own experience and observation, hates
what is dry and dull, and throws in an air of high health, buoyant
spirits, fortune and splendid connections to give animation and vividness
to what perhaps might otherwise want it. He selects what is
palpable without being gross or trivial, lends it colour from the flush
of success, and elevation from the distinctions of rank. He runs on
and never stops for an answer, rather dictating to others than endeavouring
to ascertain their opinions, solving his own questions, improving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>upon their hints, and bearing down or precluding opposition by a
good-natured loquacity or stately dogmatism. All this is perhaps
more edifying as a subject of speculation than delightful in itself.
Shakspeare somewhere says—‘A man’s mind is parcel of his fortunes,’—and
I think the inference will be borne out in the present case. I
should guess that in the prevailing tone of fashionable society or
aristocratic literature would be found all that variety, splendour,
facility, and startling effect which corresponds with external wealth,
magnificence of appearance, and a command of opportunity; while
there would be wanting whatever depends chiefly on intensity of
pursuit, on depth of feeling, and on simplicity and independence of
mind joined with straitened fortune. Prosperity is a great teacher;
adversity is a greater. Possession pampers the mind; privation trains
and strengthens it. Accordingly, we find but one really great name
(Lord Bacon) in this rank of English society, where superiority is
taken for granted, and reflected from outward circumstances. The
rest are in the second class. Lord Bolingbroke, whom Pope idolized
(and it pains me that all his idols are not mine) was a boastful empty
mouther! I never knew till the other day, that Lord Bolingbroke
was the model on which Mr. Pitt formed himself. He was his
<em>Magnus Apollo</em>; and no wonder. The late Minister used to lament
it as the great desideratum of English literature, that there was no
record anywhere existing of his speeches as they were spoken, and
declared that he would give any price for one of them reported as
speeches were reported in the newspapers in our time. Being asked
which he thought the best of his written productions, he would
answer, raising his eyebrows and deepening the tones of his voice to
a sonorous bass—‘Why, undoubtedly, Sir, the Letter to Sir William
Wyndham is the most masterly of all his writings, and the first composition
for wit and eloquence in the English language;‘—and then
he would give his reasons at great length and <i><span lang="it">con amore</span></i>, and say that
Junius had formed himself entirely upon it. Lord Bolingbroke had,
it seems, a house next-door to one belonging to Lord Chatham at
Walham-Green; and as the gardens joined, they could hear Lord
Bolingbroke walking out with the company that came to see him in
his retirement, and elaborately declaiming politics to the old lords and
statesmen that were with him, and philosophy to the younger ones.
Pitt learned this story from his father when a boy. This account,
interesting in itself, was to me the more interesting and extraordinary,
as it had always appeared to me that Mr. Pitt was quite an original,

grounded himself upon, he had neither admiration nor consciousness

sound of his own voice and revolved in the circle of his own hollow
and artificial periods. I have it from the same authority that he
thought Cobbett the best writer and Horne Tooke the cleverest man
of the day. His hatred of Wyndham was excessive and mutual.—Perhaps
it may be said that Lord Chatham was a first-rate man in
his way, and I incline to think it; but he was a self-made man, bred
in a camp, not in a court, and his rank was owing to his talents.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><em>Horas non numero nisi serenas</em>—is the motto of a sun-dial near
Venice. There is a softness and a harmony in the words and in the
thought unparalleled. Of all conceits it is surely the most classical.
‘I count only the hours that are serene.’ What a bland and care-dispelling
feeling! How the shadows seem to fade on the dial-plate
as the sky lours, and time presents only a blank unless as its progress
is marked by what is joyous, and all that is not happy sinks into
oblivion! What a fine lesson is conveyed to the mind—to take no
note of time but by its benefits, to watch only for the smiles and
neglect the frowns of fate, to compose our lives of bright and gentle
moments, turning always to the sunny side of things, and letting the
rest slip from our imaginations, unheeded or forgotten! How different
from the common art of self-tormenting! For myself, as I rode
along the Brenta, while the sun shone hot upon its sluggish, slimy
waves, my sensations were far from comfortable; but the reading this
inscription on the side of a glaring wall in an instant restored me to
myself; and still, whenever I think of or repeat it, it has the power
of wafting me into the region of pure and blissful abstraction. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>cannot help fancying it to be a legend of Popish superstition. Some
monk of the dark ages must have invented and bequeathed it to us,
who, loitering in trim gardens and watching the silent march of time,
as his fruits ripened in the sun or his flowers scented the balmy air,
felt a mild languor pervade his senses, and having little to do or to
care for, determined (in imitation of his sun-dial) to efface that little
from his thoughts or draw a veil over it, making of his life one long
dream of quiet! <em>Horas non numero nisi serenas</em>—he might repeat,
when the heavens were overcast and the gathering storm scattered the
falling leaves, and turn to his books and wrap himself in his golden
studies! Out of some such mood of mind, indolent, elegant,
thoughtful, this exquisite device (speaking volumes) must have
originated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the several modes of counting time, that by the sun-dial is
perhaps the most apposite and striking, if not the most convenient or
comprehensive. It does not obtrude its observations, though it
‘morals on the time,’ and, by its stationary character, forms a
contrast to the most fleeting of all essences. It stands <em>sub dio</em>—under
the marble air, and there is some connexion between the image
of infinity and eternity. I should also like to have a sunflower growing
near it with bees fluttering round.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a> It should be of iron to
denote duration, and have a dull, leaden look. I hate a sun-dial
made of wood, which is rather calculated to show the variations of
the seasons, than the progress of time, slow, silent, imperceptible,
chequered with light and shade. If our hours were all serene, we
might probably take almost as little note of them, as the dial does of
those that are clouded. It is the shadow thrown across, that gives
us warning of their flight. Otherwise, our impressions would take
the same undistinguishable hue; we should scarce be conscious of
our existence. Those who have had none of the cares of this life to
harass and disturb them, have been obliged to have recourse to the
hopes and fears of the next to enliven the prospect before them. Most
of the methods for measuring the lapse of time have, I believe, been
the contrivance of monks and religious recluses, who, finding time
hang heavy on their hands, were at some pains to see how they got
rid of it. The hour-glass is, I suspect, an older invention; and it is
certainly the most defective of all. Its creeping sands are not indeed
an unapt emblem of the minute, countless portions of our existence;
and the manner in which they gradually slide through the hollow
glass and diminish in number till not a single one is left, also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>illustrates the way in which our years slip from us by stealth: but
as a mechanical invention, it is rather a hindrance than a help, for
it requires to have the time, of which it pretends to count the precious
moments, taken up in attention to itself, and in seeing that when one
end of the glass is empty, we turn it round, in order that it may go
on again, or else all our labour is lost, and we must wait for some
other mode of ascertaining the time before we can recover our
reckoning and proceed as before. The philosopher in his cell, the
cottager at her spinning-wheel must, however, find an invaluable
acquisition in this ‘companion of the lonely hour,’ as it has been
called,<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a> which not only serves to tell how the time goes, but to fill up
its vacancies. What a treasure must not the little box seem to hold,
as if it were a sacred deposit of the very grains and fleeting sands of
life! What a business, in lieu of other more important avocations,
to see it out to the last sand, and then to renew the process again on
the instant, that there may not be the least flaw or error in the
account! What a strong sense must be brought home to the mind
of the value and irrecoverable nature of the time that is fled; what a
thrilling, incessant consciousness of the slippery tenure by which we
hold what remains of it! Our very existence must seem crumbling
to atoms, and running down (without a miraculous reprieve) to the
last fragment. ‘Dust to dust and ashes to ashes’ is a text that
might be fairly inscribed on an hour-glass: it is ordinarily associated
with the scythe of Time and a Death’s head, as a <em>Memento mori</em>;
and has, no doubt, furnished many a tacit hint to the apprehensive
and visionary enthusiast in favour of a resurrection to another life!</p>

<p class='c007'>The French give a different turn to things, less <em>sombre</em> and less
edifying. A common and also a very pleasing ornament to a clock,
in Paris, is a figure of Time seated in a boat which Cupid is rowing
along, with the motto, <em>L’Amour fait passer le Tems</em>—which the wits
again have travestied into <em>Le Tems fait passer L’Amour</em>. All this is
ingenious and well; but it wants sentiment. I like a people who
have something that they love and something that they hate, and with
whom every thing is not alike a matter of indifference or <i><span lang="fr">pour passer
le tems</span></i>. The French attach no importance to any thing, except for
the moment; they are only thinking how they shall get rid of one
sensation for another; all their ideas are <i><span lang="la">in transitu</span></i>. Every thing is
detached, nothing is accumulated. It would be a million of years
before a Frenchman would think of the <i><span lang="la">Horas non numero nisi serenas</span></i>.
Its impassioned repose and <em>ideal</em> voluptuousness are as far from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>breasts as the poetry of that line in Shakspeare—‘How sweet the
moonlight sleeps upon that bank!’ They never arrive at the classical—or
the romantic. They blow the bubbles of vanity, fashion, and
pleasure; but they do not expand their perceptions into refinement,
or strengthen them into solidity. Where there is nothing fine in the
ground-work of the imagination, nothing fine in the superstructure can
be produced. They are light, airy, fanciful (to give them their due)—but
when they attempt to be serious (beyond mere good sense)
they are either dull or extravagant. When the volatile salt has
flown off, nothing but a <i><span lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i> remains. They have infinite
crotchets and caprices with their clocks and watches, which seem
made for any thing but to tell the hour—gold-repeaters, watches
with metal covers, clocks with hands to count the seconds. There
is no escaping from quackery and impertinence, even in our attempts
to calculate the waste of time. The years gallop fast enough for me,
without remarking every moment as it flies; and farther, I must say
I dislike a watch (whether of French or English manufacture) that
comes to me like a footpad with its face muffled, and does not
present its clear, open aspect like a friend, and point with its finger
to the time of day. All this opening and shutting of dull, heavy
cases (under pretence that the glass-lid is liable to be broken, or lets
in the dust or air and obstructs the movement of the watch), is not to
husband time, but to give trouble. It is mere pomposity and self-importance,
like consulting a mysterious oracle that one carries about
with one in one’s pocket, instead of asking a common question of an
acquaintance or companion. There are two clocks which strike the
hour in the room where I am. This I do not like. In the first
place, I do not want to be reminded twice how the time goes (it
is like the second tap of a saucy servant at your door when perhaps
you have no wish to get up): in the next place, it is starting a difference
of opinion on the subject, and I am averse to every appearance
of wrangling and disputation. Time moves on the same, whatever
disparity there may be in our mode of keeping count of it, like true
fame in spite of the cavils and contradictions of the critics. I am no
friend to repeating watches. The only pleasant association I have
with them is the account given by Rousseau of some French lady,
who sat up reading the <cite>New Heloise</cite> when it first came out, and
ordering her maid to sound the repeater, found it was too late to go to
bed, and continued reading on till morning. Yet how different is the
interest excited by this story from the account which Rousseau somewhere
else gives of his sitting up with his father reading romances,
when a boy, till they were startled by the swallows twittering in their
nests at day-break, and the father cried out, half angry and ashamed—‘<i><span lang="fr">Allons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>mon fils; je suis plus enfant que toi!</span></i>’ In general, I have
heard repeating watches sounded in stage-coaches at night, when some
fellow-traveller suddenly awaking and wondering what was the hour,
another has very deliberately taken out his watch, and pressing the
spring, it has counted out the time; each petty stroke acting like a
sharp puncture on the ear, and informing me of the dreary hours I
had already passed, and of the more dreary ones I had to wait till
morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great advantage, it is true, which clocks have over watches
and other dumb reckoners of time is, that for the most part they
strike the hour—that they are as it were the mouth-pieces of time;
that they not only point it to the eye, but impress it on the ear; that
they ‘lend it both an understanding and a tongue.’ Time thus speaks
to us in an audible and warning voice. Objects of sight are easily
distinguished by the sense, and suggest useful reflections to the mind;
sounds, from their intermittent nature, and perhaps other causes,
appeal more to the imagination, and strike upon the heart. But to
do this, they must be unexpected and involuntary—there must be no
trick in the case—they should not be squeezed out with a finger and
a thumb; there should be nothing optional, personal in their occurrence;
they should be like stern, inflexible monitors, that nothing can
prevent from discharging their duty. Surely, if there is any thing
with which we should not mix up our vanity and self-consequence, it
is with Time, the most independent of all things. All the sublimity,
all the superstition that hang upon this palpable mode of announcing
its flight, are chiefly attached to this circumstance. Time would lose
its abstracted character, if we kept it like a curiosity or a jack-in-a-box:
its prophetic warnings would have no effect, if it obviously
spoke only at our prompting, like a paltry ventriloquism. The clock
that tells the coming, dreaded hour—the castle bell, that ‘with its
brazen throat and iron tongue, sounds one unto the drowsy ear of
night’—the curfew, ‘swinging slow with sullen roar’ o’er wizard
stream or fountain, are like a voice from other worlds, big with unknown
events. The last sound, which is still kept up as an old
custom in many parts of England, is a great favourite with me. I
used to hear it when a boy. It tells a tale of other times. The days
that are past, the generations that are gone, the tangled forest glades
and hamlets brown of my native country, the woodsman’s art, the
Norman warrior armed for the battle or in his festive hall, the
conqueror’s iron rule and peasant’s lamp extinguished, all start up at
the clamorous peal, and fill my mind with fear and wonder. I
confess, nothing at present interests me but what has been—the
recollection of the impressions of my early life, or events long past,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>of which only the dim traces remain in a smouldering ruin or half-obsolete
custom. That <em>things should be that are now no more</em>, creates
in my mind the most unfeigned astonishment. I cannot solve the
mystery of the past, nor exhaust my pleasure in it. The years, the
generations to come, are nothing to me. We care no more about the
world in the year 2300 than we do about one of the planets. Even
George IV. is better than the Earl of Windsor. We might as well
make a voyage to the moon as think of stealing a march upon Time
with impunity. <i><span lang="la">De non apparentibus et non existentibus eadem est ratio.</span></i>
Those who are to come after us and push us from the stage seem like
upstarts and pretenders, that may be said to exist <em>in vacuo</em>, we know
not upon what, except as they are blown up with vain and self-conceit
by their patrons among the moderns. But the ancients are
true and <i><span lang="la">bonâ-fide</span></i> people, to whom we are bound by aggregate
knowledge and filial ties, and in whom seen by the mellow light of
history we feel our own existence doubled and our pride consoled,
as we ruminate on the vestiges of the past. The public in general,
however, do not carry this speculative indifference about the future to
what is to happen to themselves, or to the part they are to act in the
busy scene. For my own part, I do; and the only wish I can form,
or that ever prompts the passing sigh, would be to live some of my
years over again—they would be those in which I enjoyed and
suffered most!</p>

<p class='c007'>The ticking of a clock in the night has nothing very interesting
nor very alarming in it, though superstition has magnified it into an
omen. In a state of vigilance or debility, it preys upon the spirits
like the persecution of a teazing pertinacious insect; and haunting
the imagination after it has ceased in reality, is converted into the
death-watch. Time is rendered vast by contemplating its minute
portions thus repeatedly and painfully urged upon its attention, as the
ocean in its immensity is composed of water-drops. A clock striking
with a clear and silver sound is a great relief in such circumstances,
breaks the spell, and resembles a sylph-like and friendly spirit in the
room. Foreigners, with all their tricks and contrivances upon clocks
and time-pieces, are strangers to the sound of village bells, though
perhaps a people that can dance may dispense with them. They
impart a pensive, wayward pleasure to the mind, and are a kind of
chronology of happy events, often serious in the retrospect—births,
marriages, and so forth. Coleridge calls them ‘the poor man’s only
music.’ A village-spire in England peeping from its cluster of trees
is always associated in imagination with this cheerful accompaniment,
and may be expected to pour its joyous tidings on the gale. In
Catholic countries, you are stunned with the everlasting tolling of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>bells to prayers or for the dead. In the Apennines, and other wild
and mountainous districts of Italy, the little chapel-bell with its simple
tinkling sound has a romantic and charming effect. The Monks in
former times appear to have taken a pride in the construction of bells
as well as churches; and some of those of the great cathedrals
abroad (as at Cologne and Rouen) may be fairly said to be hoarse
with counting the flight of ages. The chimes in Holland are a
nuisance. They dance in the hours and the quarters. They leave
no respite to the imagination. Before one set has done ringing in
your ears, another begins. You do not know whether the hours
move or stand still, go backwards or forwards, so fantastical and
perplexing are their accompaniments. Time is a more staid personage,
and not so full of gambols. It puts you in mind of a tune with
variations, or of an embroidered dress. Surely, nothing is more
simple than time. His march is straightforward; but we should
have leisure allowed us to look back upon the distance we have come,
and not be counting his steps every moment. Time in Holland is a
foolish old fellow with all the antics of a youth, who ‘goes to church
in a coranto, and lights his pipe in a cinque-pace.’ The chimes with
us, on the contrary, as they come in every three or four hours, are
like stages in the journey of the day. They give a fillip to the lazy,
creeping hours, and relieve the lassitude of country places. At noon,
their desultory, trivial song is diffused through the hamlet with the
odour of rashers of bacon; at the close of day they send the toil-worn
sleepers to their beds. Their discontinuance would be a great
loss to the thinking or unthinking public. Mr. Wordsworth has
painted their effect on the mind when he makes his friend Matthew,
in a fit of inspired dotage,</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The tolling of the bell for deaths and executions is a fearful
summons, though, as it announces, not the advance of time but the
approach of fate, it happily makes no part of our subject. Otherwise,
the ‘sound of the bell’ for Macheath’s execution in the ‘Beggar’s
Opera,’ or for that of the Conspirators in ‘Venice Preserved,’ with
the roll of the drum at a soldier’s funeral, and a digression to that of
my Uncle Toby, as it is so finely described by Sterne, would furnish
ample topics to descant upon. If I were a moralist, I might disapprove
the ringing in the new and ringing out the old year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who have no artificial means of ascertaining the progress of
time, are in general the most acute in discerning its immediate signs,
and are most retentive of individual dates. The mechanical aids to
knowledge are not sharpeners of the wits. The understanding of a
savage is a kind of natural almanac, and more true in its prognostication
of the future. In his mind’s eye he sees what has happened or
what is likely to happen to him, ‘as in a map the voyager his course.’
Those who read the times and seasons in the aspect of the heavens
and the configurations of the stars, who count by moons and know
when the sun rises and sets, are by no means ignorant of their own
affairs or of the common concatenation of events. People in such
situations have not their faculties distracted by any multiplicity of
inquiries beyond what befalls themselves, and the outward appearances
that mark the change. There is, therefore, a simplicity and clearness
in the knowledge they possess, which often puzzles the more
learned. I am sometimes surprised at a shepherd-boy by the road-side,
who sees nothing but the earth and sky, asking me the time of
day—he ought to know so much better than any one how far the sun
is above the horizon. I suppose he wants to ask a question of a
passenger, or to see if he has a watch. Robinson Crusoe lost his
reckoning in the monotony of his life and that bewildering dream of
solitude, and was fain to have recourse to the notches in a piece of
wood. What a diary was his! And how time must have spread its
circuit round him, vast and pathless as the ocean!</p>

<p class='c007'>For myself, I have never had a watch nor any other mode of
keeping time in my possession, nor ever wish to learn how time goes.
It is a sign I have had little to do, few avocations, few engagements.
When I am in a town, I can hear the clock; and when I am in the
country, I can listen to the silence. What I like best is to lie whole
mornings on a sunny bank on Salisbury Plain, without any object
before me, neither knowing nor caring how time passes, and thus
‘with light-winged toys of feathered Idleness’ to melt down hours
to moments. Perhaps some such thoughts as I have here set down
float before me like motes before my half-shut eyes, or some vivid
image of the past by forcible contrast rushes by me—‘Diana and her
fawn, and all the glories of the antique world;’ then I start away to
prevent the iron from entering my soul, and let fall some tears into
that stream of time which separates me farther and farther from all I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>once loved! At length I rouse myself from my reverie, and home
to dinner, proud of killing time with thought, nay even without
thinking. Somewhat of this idle humour I inherit from my father,
though he had not the same freedom from <em>ennui</em>, for he was not a
metaphysician; and there were stops and vacant intervals in his being
which he did not know how to fill up. He used in these cases, and
as an obvious resource, carefully to wind up his watch at night, and
‘with lack-lustre eye’ more than once in the course of the day look
to see what o’clock it was. Yet he had nothing else in his character
in common with the elder Mr. Shandy. Were I to attempt a
sketch of him, for my own or the reader’s satisfaction, it would be
after the following manner:——but now I recollect, I have done
something of the kind once before, and were I to resume the subject
here, some bat or owl of a critic, with spectacled gravity, might
swear I had stolen the whole of this Essay from myself—or (what is
worse) from him! So I had better let it go as it is.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>WHY THE HEROES OF ROMANCE ARE INSIPID</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The New Monthly Magazine.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>November, 1827.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>Because it is taken for granted that they must be amiable and interesting,
in the first instance, and like other things that are taken for
granted, is but indifferently, or indeed cannot be made out at all in
the sequel. To put it to the proof, to give illustrations of it, would
be to throw a doubt upon the question. They have only to show
themselves to ensure conquest. Indeed, the reputation of their
victories goes before them, and is a pledge of their success before they
even appear. They are, or are supposed to be, so amiable, so handsome,
so accomplished, so captivating, that all hearts bow before them,
and all the women are in love with them without knowing why or
wherefore, except that it is understood that they are to be so. All
obstacles vanish without a finger lifted or a word spoken, and the
effect is produced without a blow being struck. When there is this
imaginary charm at work, every thing they could do or say must
weaken the impression, like arguments brought in favour of a self-evident
truth: they very wisely say or do little or nothing, rely on
their names and the author’s good word, look, smile, and are adored;
but to all but the heroines of romance and their confidantes, are
exceedingly uninteresting and <em>common-place</em> personages, either great
coxcombs or wonderfully insipid. When a lover is able to look
unutterable things which produce the desired effect, what occasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>for him to exert his eloquence or make an impassioned speech in
order to bring about a revolution in his favour, which is already
accomplished by other less doubtful means? When the impression
at first sight is complete and irresistible, why throw away any farther
thoughts or words to make it more so? This were ‘to gild refined
gold, to paint the lily, to smooth the ice, to throw a perfume on the
violet, or add another hue unto the rainbow, or seek with taper-light
the beauteous eye of Heaven to garnish,’ which has been pronounced
to be ‘wasteful and superfluous excess.’ Authors and novel-writers
therefore reserve for their second-rate and less prominent characters,
the artillery of words, the arts of persuasion, and all the unavailing
battery of hopeless attentions and fine sentiment, which are of no use
to the more accomplished gallant, who makes his triumphant approaches
by stolen glances and breathing sighs, and whose appearance alone
supersedes the disclosure of all his other implied perfections and an
importunate display of a long list of titles to the favour of the fair,
which, as they are not insisted on, it would be vain and unbecoming
to produce to the gaze of the world, or for the edification of the
curious reader. It is quite enough if the lady is satisfied with her
choice, and if (as generally happens both as a cause and consequence
in such cases) the gentleman is satisfied with himself. If he indeed
seemed to entertain a doubt upon the subject, the spell of his fascination
would be broken, and the author would be obliged to derogate
from the <em>beau-ideal</em> of his character, and make him do something to
deserve the good opinion that might be entertained of him, and to
which he himself had not led the way by boundless self-complacency
and the conscious assurance of infallible success.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another circumstance that keeps our novel-heroes in the back-ground
is, that if there was any doubt of their success, or they were obliged
to employ the ordinary and vulgar means to establish their superiority
over every one else, they would be no longer those ‘faultless monsters’
which it is understood that they must be to fill their part in the drama.
The discarded or despairing, not the favoured lovers, are unavoidably
the most interesting persons in the story. In fact, the principals are
already disposed of in the first page; they are destined for each other
by an unaccountable and uncontrollable sympathy: the ceremony is in
a manner over, and they are already married people, with all the
lawful attributes and indifference belonging to the character. To
produce an interest, there must be mixed motives, alternate hope and
fear, difficulties to struggle with, sacrifices to make; but the true
hero of romance is too fine a gentleman to be subjected to this rude
ordeal, or mortifying exposure, which devolves upon some much more
unworthy and unpretending personage. The beauty of the outline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>must not be disturbed by the painful conflicts of passion or the strong
contrast of light and shade. The taste of the heroic cannot swerve
for a moment from the object of its previous choice, who must never
be placed in disadvantageous circumstances. The top characters
occupy a certain prescriptive rank in the world of romance, by the
rules of etiquette and laws of this sort of fictitious composition, reign
like princes, and have only to do nothing to forfeit their privileges or
compromise their supposed dignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes of the old romances, the Grand Cyruses, the Artamenes,
and Oroondates, are in this respect better than the moderns. They
had their steel helmet and plume of feathers, the glittering spear and
shield, the barbed steed, and the spread banner, and had knightly
service to perform in joust and tournament, in the field of battle or
the deep forest, besides the duty which they owed to their ‘mistress’
eyebrow,’ and the favours they received at her hands. They were
comparatively picturesque and adventurous personages, and men of
action in the tented field, and lost all title to the smile of beauty if
they did not deserve it by feats of prowess, and by the valour of their
arms. However insipid they might be as accepted lovers, in their
set speeches and improgressive languishments by which they paid their
court to their hearts’ idols, the ‘fairest of the fair,’ yet in their
character of warriors and heroes, they were men of mettle, and had
something in them. They did not merely sigh and smile and kneel
in the presence of their mistresses—they had to unhorse their adversaries
in combat, to storm castles, to vanquish giants, and lead armies.
So far, so well. In the good old times of chivalry and romance,
favour was won and maintained by the bold achievements and fair
fame of the chosen knight, which keeps up a show of suspense and
dramatic interest, instead of depending, as in more effeminate times,
on taste, sympathy, and a refinement of sentiment and manners, of the
delicacy of which it is impossible to convey any idea by words or
actions. Even in the pompous and affected courtship of the romances
of the seventeenth century (now, alas! exploded) the interviews
between the lovers are so rare and guarded, their union, though agreed
upon and inevitable, is so remote, the smile with which the lady
regards her sworn champion, though as steady as that of one of the
fixed stars, is like them so cold, as to give a tone of passion and interest
to their enamoured flights, as though they were affected by the chances
and changes of sublunary affairs. I confess I have read some of these
fabulous folios formerly with no small degree of delight and breathless
anxiety, particularly that of ‘Cassandra’; and would willingly indeed
go over it again to catch even a faint, a momentary glimpse of the
pleasure with which I used at one period to peruse its prolix descriptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and high-flown sentiments. Not only the Palmerins of England
and Amadises of Gaul, who made their way to their mistresses’
hearts by slaying giants and taming dragons, but the heroes of the
French romances of intrigue and gallantry which succeeded those of
necromancy and chivalry, and where the adventurers for the prize
have to break through the fences of morality and scruples of conscience
instead of stone-walls and enchantments dire, are to be excepted from
the censure of downright insipidity which attaches to those ordinary
drawing-room heroes, who are installed in the good graces of their
Divinities by a look, and keep their places there by the force of <em>still-life</em>!
It is Gray who cries out, ‘Be mine to read eternal new
romances of Marivaux and Crebillon!’ I could say the same of
those of Madame La Fayette and the Duke de la Rochefoucault.
‘The Princess of Cleves’ is a most charming work of this kind; and
the Duke de Nemours is a great favourite with me. He is perhaps
the most brilliant personage that ever entered upon the <em>tapis</em> of a
drawing-room, or trifled at a lady’s toilette.</p>

<p class='c007'>I prefer him, I own, vastly to Richardson’s Sir Charles Grandison,
whom I look upon as the prince of coxcombs; and so much the more
impertinent as he is a moral one. His character appears to me ‘ugly
all over with affectation.’ There is not a single thing that Sir Charles
Grandison does or says all through the book from liking to any person
or object but himself, and with a view to answer to a certain standard
of perfection for which he pragmatically sets up. He is always
thinking of himself, and trying to show that he is the wisest, happiest,
and most virtuous person in the whole world. He is (or would be
thought) a code of Christian ethics; a compilation and abstract of all
gentlemanly accomplishments. There is nothing, I conceive, that
excites so little sympathy as this inordinate egotism; or so much
disgust as this everlasting self-complacency. Yet this self-admiration,
brought forward on every occasion as the incentive to every action
and reflected from all around him, is the burden and pivot of the story.
‘Is not the man Sir Charles Grandison?’—is what he and all the
other persons concerned are continually repeating to themselves. His
preference of the little, insignificant, selfish, affected, puritanical Miss
Byron, who is remarkable for nothing but her conceit of herself and
her lover, to the noble Clementina, must for ever stamp him for the
poltroon and blockhead that he was. What a contrast between these
two females—the one, the favourite heroine, settling her idle punctilios
and the choice of her ribbons for the wedding-day with equal interest,
the other, self-devoted, broken-hearted, generous, disinterested, pouring
out her whole soul in the fervent expressions and dying struggles of an
unfortunate and hopeless affection! It was impossible indeed for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>genius of the author (strive all he could) to put the prettinesses and
coquettish scruples of the bride-elect upon a par with the eloquent
despair and impassioned sentiments of her majestic but unsuccessful
rival. Nothing can show more clearly that the height of good fortune
and of that conventional faultlessness which is supposed to secure it, is
incompatible with any great degree of interest. Lady Clementina
should have been married to Sir Charles to surfeit her of a coxcomb—Miss
Byron to Lovelace to plague her with a rake! Have we
not sometimes seen such matches? A slashing critic of my acquaintance
once observed, that ‘Richardson would be surprised in the next
world to find Lovelace in Heaven and Grandison in Hell!’ Without
going this orthodox length, I must say there is something in
Lovelace’s vices more attractive than in the other’s best virtues.
Clarissa’s attachment seems as natural as Clementina’s is romantic.
There is a <em>regality</em> about Lovelace’s manner, and he appears clothed
in a panoply of wit, gaiety, spirit, and enterprise, that is criticism-proof.
If he had not possessed these dazzling qualities, nothing
could have made us forgive for an instant his treatment of the spotless
Clarissa; but indeed they might be said to be mutually attracted to
and extinguished in each other’s dazzling lustre! When we think
of Lovelace and his luckless exploits, we can hardly be persuaded at
this time of day that he wore a wig. Yet that he did so is evident;
for Miss Howe when she gave him that spirited box on the ear,
struck the powder out of it! Mr. B. in ‘Pamela’ has all the insipidity,
that arises from patronising beauty and condescending to virtue.
Pamela herself is delightfully made out; but she labours under
considerable disadvantages, and is far from a <em>regular</em> heroine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sterne (thank God!) has neither hero nor heroine, and he does
very well without them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many people find fault with Fielding’s Tom Jones as gross and
immoral. For my part, I have doubts of his being so very handsome
from the author’s always talking about his beauty, and I suspect he
was a clown, from being constantly assured he was so very genteel.
Otherwise, I think Jones acquits himself very well both in his actions
and speeches, as a lover and as a <em>trencher-man</em> whenever he is called
upon. Some persons, from their antipathy to that headlong impulse,
of which Jones was the slave, and to that morality of good-nature
which in him is made a foil to principle, have gone so far as to prefer
Blifil as the <em>prettier fellow</em> of the two. I certainly cannot subscribe
to this opinion, which perhaps was never meant to have followers, and
has nothing but its singularity to recommend it. Joseph Andrews is
a hero of the shoulder-knot: it would be hard to canvass his pretensions
too severely, especially considering what a patron he has in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Parson Adams. That one character would cut up into a hundred
fine gentlemen and novel-heroes! Booth is another of the good-natured
tribe, a fine man, a very fine man! But there is a want of
spirit to animate the well-meaning mass. He hardly deserved to
have the hashed mutton kept waiting for him. The author has
redeemed himself in Amelia; but a heroine with a <em>broken nose</em> and
who was a married woman besides, must be rendered truly interesting
and amiable to make up for superficial objections. The character of
the Noble Peer in this novel is <em>not</em> insipid. If Fielding could have
made virtue as admirable as he could make vice detestable, he would
have been a greater master even than he was. I do not understand
what those critics mean who say he got all his characters out of alehouses.
It is true he did some of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Smollett’s heroes are neither one thing nor the other: neither very
refined nor very insipid. Wilson in Humphrey Clinker comes the
nearest to the <em>beau-ideal</em> of this character, the favourite of the novel-reading
and boarding-school girl. Narcissa and Emilia Gauntlet are
very charming girls; and Monimia in Count Fathom is a fine monumental
beauty. But perhaps he must be allowed to be most <em>at home</em>
in Winifred Jenkins!</p>

<p class='c007'>The women have taken this matter up in our own time: let us see
what they have made of it. Mrs. Radcliffe’s heroes and lovers are
perfect in their kind; nobody can find any fault with them, for nobody
knows any thing about them. They are described as very handsome,
and quite unmeaning and inoffensive.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Her heroes have no character at all.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Theodore, Valancourt,—what delightful names! and there is nothing
else to distinguish them by. Perhaps, however, this indefiniteness
is an advantage. We add expression to the inanimate outline, and
fill up the blank with all that is amiable, interesting, and romantic.
A long ride without a word spoken, a meeting that comes to nothing,
a parting look, a moonlight scene, or evening skies that paint their
sentiments for them better than the lovers can do for themselves,
farewells too full of anguish, deliverances too big with joy to admit of
words, suppressed sighs, faint smiles, the freshness of the morning,
pale melancholy, the clash of swords, the clank of chains that make
the fair one’s heart sink within her, these are the chief means by
which the admired authoress of ‘The Romance of the Forest’ and
‘The Mysteries of Udolpho’ keeps alive an ambiguous interest in
the bosom of her fastidious readers, and elevates the lover into the
hero of the fable. Unintelligible distinctions, impossible attempts, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>delicacy that shrinks from the most trifling objection, and an enthusiasm
that rushes on its fate, such are the charming and teazing
contradictions that form the flimsy texture of a modern romance!
If the lover in such critical cases was any thing but a lover, he would
cease to be the most amiable of all characters in the abstract and by
way of excellence, and would be a traitor to the cause; to give
reasons or to descend to particulars, is to doubt the omnipotence of
love and shake the empire of credulous fancy; a sounding name, a
graceful form, are all that is necessary to suspend the whole train of
tears, sighs, and the softest emotions upon; the ethereal nature of the
passion requires ethereal food to sustain it; and our youthful hero, in
order to be perfectly interesting, must be drawn as perfectly insipid!</p>

<p class='c007'>I cannot, however, apply this charge to Mrs. Inchbald’s heroes or
heroines. However finely drawn, they are an essence of sentiment.
Their words are composed of the warmest breath, their tears scald,
their sighs stifle. Her characters seem moulded of a softer clay, the
work of fairest hands. Miss Milner is enchanting. Doriforth
indeed is severe, and has a very stately opinion of himself, but he has
spirit and passion. Lord Norwynne is the most unpleasant and
obdurate. He seduces by his situation and kills by indifference, as is
natural in such cases. But still through all these the fascination of
the writer’s personal feelings never quits you. On the other hand,
Miss Burney’s (Madame D’Arblay’s) <em>forte</em> is ridicule, or an exquisite
tact for minute absurdities, and when she aims at being fine she only
becomes affected. No one had ever much less of the romantic.
Lord Orville is a condescending suit of clothes; yet certainly the
sense which Evelina has of the honour done her is very prettily
managed. Sir Clement Willoughby is a much gayer and more
animated person, though his wit outruns his discretion. Young
Delville is the hero of punctilio—a perfect diplomatist in the art of
love-making—and draws his parallels and sits down as deliberately
before the citadel of his mistress’s heart, as a cautious general lays
siege to an impregnable fortress. Cecilia is not behind-hand with
him in the game of studied cross-purposes and affected delays, and is
almost the veriest and most provoking trifler on record. Miss
Edgeworth, I believe, has no heroes. Her <em>trenchant</em> pen cuts away
all extravagance and idle pretence, and leaves nothing but common
sense, prudence, and propriety behind it, wherever it comes.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not apprehend that the heroes of the Author of Waverley form
any very striking exception to the common rule. They conform to
their designation and follow the general law of their being. They
are for the most part very equivocal and undecided personages, who
receive their governing impulse from accident, or are puppets in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>hands of their mistresses, such as Waverley, Ivanhoe, Frank Osbaldistone,
Henry Morton, &#38;c. I do not say that any of these are
absolutely insipid, but they have in themselves no leading or master-traits,
and they are worked out of very listless and inert materials
into a degree of force and prominence solely by the genius of the
author. Instead of acting, they are acted upon, and keep in the
back-ground and in a neutral posture, till they are absolutely forced
to come forward, and it is then with a very amiable reservation of
modest scruples. Does it not seem almost, or generally speaking, as
if a character to be put in this responsible situation of candidate for
the highest favour of the public at large, or of the fair in particular,
who is to conciliate all suffrages and concentrate all interests, must
really have nothing in him to please or give offence, that he must be
left a negative, feeble character without untractable or uncompromising
points, and with a few slight recommendations and obvious good
qualities which every one may be supposed to improve upon and fill
up according to his or her inclination or fancy and the model of perfection
previously existing in the mind? It is a privilege claimed, no
doubt, by the fair reader to make out the object of her admiration
and interest according to her own choice; and the same privilege, if
not openly claimed, may be covertly exercised by others. We are
all fond of our own creations, and if the author does little to his chief
character and allows us to have a considerable hand in it, it may not
suffer in our opinion from this circumstance. In fact, the hero of the
work is not so properly the chief object in it, as a sort of blank left
open to the imagination, or a lay-figure on which the reader disposes
whatever drapery he pleases! Of all Sir Walter’s characters
the most dashing and spirited is the Sultan Saladin. But he is not
meant for a hero, nor fated to be a lover. He is a collateral and
incidental performer in the scene. His movements therefore remain
free, and he is master of his own resplendent energies, which produce
so much the more daring and felicitous an effect. So far from being
intended to please all tastes or the most squeamish, he is not meant
for any taste. He has no pretensions, and stands upon the sole
ground of his own heroic acts and sayings. The author has none of
the timidity or mawkishness arising from a fear of not coming up to
his own professions, or to the expectations excited in the reader’s
mind. Any striking trait, any interesting exploit is more than was
bargained for—is heaped measure, running over. There is no idle,
nervous apprehension of falling short of perfection, arresting the hand
or diverting the mind from truth and nature. If the Pagan is not
represented as a monster and barbarian, all the rest is a god-send.
Accordingly all is spontaneous, bold, and original in this beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and glowing design, which is as magnificent as it is magnanimous.—Lest
I should forget it, I will mention while I am on the subject of
Scotch novels, that Mackenzie’s ‘Man of Feeling’ is not without
interest, but it is an interest brought out in a very singular and unprecedented
way. He not merely says or does nothing to deserve the
approbation of the goddess of his idolatry, but from extreme shyness
and sensitiveness, instead of presuming on his merits, gets out of her
way, and only declares his passion on his death-bed. Poor Harley!—Mr.
Godwin’s Falkland is a very high and heroic character: he,
however, is not a love-hero; and the only part in which an episode
of this kind is introduced, is of the most trite and mawkish description.
The case is different in St. Leon. The author’s resuscitated hero
there quaffs joy, love, and immortality with a considerable <em>gusto</em>, and
with appropriate manifestations of triumph.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the heroes of the philosophical school of romance, such as
Goethe’s Werther, &#38;c., they are evidently out of the pale of this
reasoning. Instead of being common-place and insipid, they are one
violent and startling paradox from beginning to end. Instead of
being cast in stiff unmeaning mould, they ‘all germins spill at once’
that make mere mortal men. They run a-tilt at all established usages
and prejudices, and overset all the existing order of society. There
is plenty of interest here; and instead of complaining of a calm, we
are borne along by a hurricane of passion and eloquence, certainly
without any thing of ‘temperance that may give it smoothness.’
Schiller’s Moor, Kotzebue’s heroes, and all the other German
prodigies are of this stamp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shakspeare’s lovers and Boccaccio’s I like much: they seem to
me full of tenderness and manly spirit, and free from insipidity and
cant. Otway’s Jaffier is, however, the true woman’s man—full of
passion and effeminacy, a mixture of strength and weakness. Perhaps
what I have said above may suggest the true reason and apology for
Milton’s having unwittingly made Satan the hero of ‘Paradise Lost.’
He suffers infinite losses, and makes the most desperate efforts to
recover or avenge them; and it is the struggle with fate and the
privation of happiness that sharpens our desires, or enhances our
sympathy with good or evil. We have little interest in unalterable
felicity, nor can we join with heart and soul in the endless symphonies
and exulting hallelujahs of the spirits of the blest. The remorse of
a fallen spirit or ‘tears such as angels shed’ touch us more nearly.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Scholars lead a contemplative and retired life, both which circumstances
must be supposed to contribute to the effect in question. A
life of study is also conversant with high and <em>ideal</em> models, which
gives an ambitious turn to the mind; and pride is nearly akin to
delicacy of feeling.</p>

<p class='c007'>That a life of privacy and obscurity should render its votaries
bashful and awkward, or unfit them for the routine of society, from
the want both of a habit of going into company and from ignorance
of its usages, is obvious to remark. No one can be expected to do
that well or without a certain degree of hesitation and restraint,
which he is not accustomed to do except on particular occasions,
and at rare intervals. You might as rationally set a scholar or a
clown on a tight-rope and expect them to dance gracefully and with
every appearance of ease, as introduce either into the gay, laughing
circle, and suppose that he will acquit himself handsomely and come
off with applause in the retailing of anecdote or the interchange of
repartee. ‘If you have not seen the Court, your manners must be
naught; and if your manners are naught, you must be damned,’ according
to Touchstone’s reasoning. The other cause lies rather deeper, and
is so far better worth considering, perhaps. A student, then, that is, a
man who condemns himself to toil for a length of time and through a
number of volumes in order to arrive at a conclusion, naturally loses
that smartness and ease which distinguish the gay and thoughtless rattler.
There is a certain elasticity of movement and hey-day of the animal
spirits seldom to be met with but in those who have never cared for
any thing beyond the moment, or looked lower than the surface. The
scholar having to encounter doubts and difficulties on all hands, and
indeed to apply by way of preference to those subjects which are
most beset with mystery, becomes hesitating, sceptical, irresolute,
absent, dull. All the processes of his mind are slow, cautious,
circuitous, instead of being prompt, heedless, straightforward.
Finding the intricacies of the path increase upon him in every
direction, this can hardly be supposed to add to the lightness of
his step, the confidence of his brow as he advances. He does not
skim the surface, but dives under it like the mole to make his way
darkling, by imperceptible degrees, and throwing up heaps of dirt and
rubbish over his head to track his progress. He is therefore startled at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>any sudden light, puzzled by any casual question, taken unawares and
at a disadvantage in every critical emergency. He must have time
given him to collect his thoughts, to consider objections, to make
farther inquiries, and come to no conclusion at last. This is very
different from the dashing, <em>off-hand</em> manner of the mere man of
business or fashion; and he who is repeatedly found in situations
to which he is unequal (particularly if he is of a reflecting and
candid temper) will be apt to look foolish, and to lose both his
countenance and his confidence in himself—at least as to the opinion
others entertain of him, and the figure he is likely on any occasion
to make in the eyes of the world. The course of his studies has
not made him wise, but has taught him the uncertainty of wisdom;
and has supplied him with excellent reasons for suspending his
judgment, when another would throw the casting-weight of his own
presumption or interest into the scale.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inquirer after truth learns to take nothing for granted; least
of all, to make an assumption of his own superior merits. He would
have nothing proceed without proper proofs and an exact scrutiny;
and would neither be imposed upon himself, nor impose upon others
by shallow and hasty appearances. It takes years of patient toil and
devoted enthusiasm to master any art or science; and after all, the
success is doubtful. He infers that other triumphs must be prepared
in like manner at an humble distance: he cannot bring himself to
imagine that any object worth seizing on or deserving of regard,
can be carried by a <em>coup de main</em>. So far from being proud or puffed
up by them, he would be ashamed and degraded in his own opinion
by any advantages that were to be obtained by such cheap and
vulgar means as putting a good face on the matter, as strutting and
vapouring about his own pretensions. He would not place himself
on a level with bullies or coxcombs; nor believe that those whose
favour he covets, can be the dupes of either. Whatever is excellent
in his fanciful creed is hard of attainment; and he would (perhaps
absurdly enough) have the means in all cases answerable to the end.
He knows that there are difficulties in his favourite pursuits to
puzzle the will, to tire the patience, to unbrace the strongest nerves,
and make the stoutest courage quail; and he would fain think that
if there is any object more worthy than another to call forth the
earnest solicitude, the hopes and fears of a wise man, and to make
his heart yearn within him at the most distant prospect of success,
this precious prize in the grand lottery of life is not to be had for
the asking for, or from the mere easy indifference or overbearing
effrontery with which you put in your claim. He is aware that it
will be long enough before any one paints a fine picture by walking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>up and down and admiring himself in the glass; or writes a fine
poem by being delighted with the sound of his own voice; or solves
a single problem in philosophy by swaggering and haughty airs. He
conceives that it is the same with the way of the world—woos the
fair as he woos the Muse; in conversation never puts in a word till
he has something better to say than any one else in the room; in
business never strikes while the iron is hot, and flings away all his
advantages by endeavouring to prove to his own and the satisfaction
of others, that he is clearly entitled to them. It never once enters
into his head (till it is too late) that impudence is the current coin
in the affairs of life; that he who doubts his own merit, never has
credit given him by others; that Fortune does not stay to have her
overtures canvassed; that he who neglects opportunity, can seldom
command it a second time; that the world judge by appearances,
not by realities; and that they sympathise more readily with those
who are prompt to do themselves justice, and to show off their
various qualifications or enforce their pretensions to the utmost, than
with those who wait for others to award their claims, and carry their
fastidious refinement into helplessness and imbecility. Thus ‘fools
rush in where angels fear to tread;’ and modest merit finds to its
cost, that the bold hand and dauntless brow succeed where timidity
and bashfulness are pushed aside; that the gay, laughing eye is
preferred to dejection and gloom, health and animal spirits to the
shattered, sickly frame and trembling nerves; and that to succeed
in life, a man should carry about with him the outward and incontrovertible
signs of success, and of his satisfaction with himself and his
prospects, instead of plaguing every body near him with fantastical
scruples and his ridiculous anxiety to realise an unattainable standard
of perfection. From holding back himself, the speculative enthusiast
is thrust back by others: his pretensions are insulted and trampled
on; and the repeated and pointed repulses he meets with, make him
still more unwilling to encounter, and more unable to contend with
those that await him in the prosecution of his career. He therefore
retires from the contest altogether, or remains in the back-ground,
a passive but uneasy spectator of a scene, in which he finds from
experience, that confidence, alertness, and superficial acquirements
are of more avail than all the refinement and delicacy in the world.
Action, in truth, is referable chiefly to quickness and strength of
resolution, rather than to depth of reasoning or scrupulous nicety:
again, it is to be presumed that those who show a proper reliance on
themselves, will not betray the trust we place in them through
pusillanimity or want of spirit: in what relates to the opinion of
others, which is often formed hastily and on slight acquaintance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>much must be allowed to what strikes the senses, to what excites
the imagination; and in all popular worldly schemes, popular and
worldly means must be resorted to, instead of depending wholly on
the hidden and intrinsic merits of the case.</p>

      <div class='line'>‘In peace, there’s nothing so becomes a man</div>
      <div class='line'>As modest stillness, and humility:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This advice (sensible as it is) is abhorrent to the nature of a man
who is accustomed to place all his hopes of victory in reasoning and
reflection only. The noisy, rude, gratuitous success of those who
have taken so much less pains to deserve it, disgusts and disheartens
him—he loses his self-possession and self-esteem, has no standard
left by which to measure himself or others, and as he cannot be
brought to admire them, persuades himself at last that the blame
rests with himself; and instead of bespeaking a fashionable dress,
learning to bow, or taking a few lessons in boxing or fencing to
brace his nerves and raise his spirits, aggravates all his former faults
by way of repairing them, grows more jealous of the propriety of
every word and look, lowers his voice into a whisper, gives his style
the last polish, reconsiders his arguments, refines his sentiments till
they evaporate in a sigh, and thus satisfies himself that he can hardly
fail, that men judge impartially in the end, that the public will
sooner or later do him justice, Fortune smile, and the Fair no longer
be averse! <em>Oh malore!</em> He is just where he was, or ten times
worse off than ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another circumstance that tends not a little to perplex
the judgment, and add to the difficulties of the retired student, when
he comes out into the world. He is like one dropped from the
clouds. He has hitherto conversed chiefly with historic personages
and abstract propositions, and has no just notion of actual men and
things. He does not well know how to reconcile the sweeping
conclusions he has been taught to indulge in to the cautious and
pliant maxims of the world, nor how to compare himself, an inhabitant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of Utopia, with sublunary mortals. He has been habituated all
his life to look up to a few great names handed down by virtue or
science as the ‘Gods of his idolatry,’ as the fixed stars in the
firmament of reputation, and to have some respect for himself and
other learned men as votaries at the shrine and as appreciating the
merits of their idol; but all the rest of the world, who are neither
the objects of this sort of homage, nor concerned as a sort of
priesthood in collecting and paying it, he looks upon as actually
nobody, or as worms crawling upon the face of the earth without
intellectual value or pretensions. He is, therefore, a little surprised
and shocked to find, when he deigns to mingle with his fellows,
those every-day mortals, on ordinary terms, that they are of a height
nearly equal to himself, that they have words, ideas, feelings in
common with the best, and are not the mere cyphers he had been
led to consider them. From having under-rated, he comes to over-rate
them. Having dreamt of no such thing, he is more struck with
what he finds than perhaps it deserves; magnifies the least glimpse
of sense or humour into sterling wit or wisdom; is startled by any
objection from so unexpected a quarter; thinks his own advantages
of no avail, because they are not the only ones, and shrinks from an
encounter with weapons he has not been used to, and from a struggle
by which he feels himself degraded. The Knight of La Mancha
when soundly beaten by the packstaves of the Yanguesian carriers,
laid all the blame on his having condescended to fight with plebeians.
The pride of learning comes in to aid the awkwardness and bashfulness
of the inexperienced novice, converting his want of success into
the shame and mortification of defeat in what he habitually considers
as a contest with inferiors. Indeed, those will always be found to
submit with the worst grace to any check or reverse of this kind in
common conversation or reasoning, who have been taught to set the
most exclusive and disproportioned value on letters: and the most
enlightened and accomplished scholars will be less likely to be
humbled or put to the blush by the display of common sense or
native talent, than the more ignorant, self-sufficient, and pedantic
among the learned; for that ignorance, self-sufficiency, and pedantry,
are sometimes to be reckoned among the attributes of learning, cannot
be disputed. These qualities are not very reconcilable with modest
merit; but they are quite consistent with a great deal of blundering,
confusion, and want of <em>tact</em> in the commerce of the world. The
genuine scholar retires from an unequal conflict into silence and
obscurity: the pedant swells into self-importance, and renders himself
conspicuous by pompous arrogance and absurdity!</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hard upon those who have ever taken pains or done any thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to distinguish themselves, that they are seldom the trumpeters of
their own achievements; and I believe it may be laid down as a
rule, that we receive just as much homage from others as we exact
from them by our own declarations, looks, and manner. But no
one who has performed any thing great looks big upon it: those
who have any thing to boast of are generally silent on that head, and
altogether shy of the subject. With Coriolanus, they ‘will not have
their nothings monster’d.’ From familiarity, his own acquirements
do not appear so extraordinary to the individual as to others; and
there is a natural want of sympathy in this respect. No one who
is really capable of great things is proud or vain of his success; for
he thinks more of what he had hoped or has failed to do, than of
what he has done. A habit of extreme exertion, or of anxious
suspense, is not one of buoyant, overweening self-complacency: those
who have all their lives tasked their faculties to the utmost, may be
supposed to have quite enough to do without having much disposition
left to anticipate their success with confidence, or to glory in it
afterwards. The labours of the mind, like the drudgery of the
body, depress and take away the usual alacrity of the spirits. Nor
can such persons be lifted up with the event; for the impression of
the consequences to result from any arduous undertaking must be
light and vain, compared with the toil and anxiety accompanying it.
It is only those who have done nothing, who fancy they can do
every thing; or who have leisure and inclination to admire themselves.
To sit before a glass and smile delighted at our own image,
is merely a tax on our egotism and self-conceit; and these are
resources not easily exhausted in some persons; or if they are, the
deficiency is supplied by flatterers who surround the vain, like a
natural atmosphere. Fools who take all their opinions at second-hand
cannot resist the coxcomb’s delight in himself; or it might
be said that folly is the natural mirror of vanity. The greatest
heroes, it has often been observed, do not show it in their faces;
nor do philosophers affect to be thought wise. Little minds triumph
on small occasions, or over puny competitors: the loftiest wish for
higher opportunities of signalising themselves, or compare themselves
with those models that leave them no room for flippant exultation.
Either great things are accomplished with labour and pains, which
stamp their impression on the general character and tone of feeling;
or if this should not be the case (as sometimes happens), and they
are the effect of genius and a happiness of nature, then they cost too
little to be much thought of, and we rather wonder at others for
admiring them, than at ourselves for having performed them. ‘Vix
ea nostra voco’—is the motto of spontaneous talent; and in neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>case is conceit the exuberant growth of great original power or of
great attainments.</p>

<p class='c007'>In one particular, the uneducated man carries it hollow against the
man of thought and refinement: the first can shoot in the <em>long bow</em>,
which the last cannot for the life of him. He who has spent the
best part of his time and wasted his best powers in endeavouring to
answer the question—‘What is truth?’—scorns a lie, and every
thing making the smallest approach to one. His mind by habit has
become tenacious of, devoted to the truth. The grossness and
vulgarity of falsehood shock the delicacy of his perceptions, as much
as it would shock the finest artist to be obliged to daub in a signpost,
or scrawl a caricature. He cannot make up his mind to derive
any benefit from so pitiful and disgusting a source. Tell me that a
man is a metaphysician, and at the same time that he is given to
shallow and sordid boasting, and I will not believe you. After
striving to raise himself to an equality with truth and nature by
patient investigation and refined distinctions (which few can make)—whether
he succeed or fail, he cannot stoop to acquire a spurious
reputation, or to advance himself or lessen others by paltry artifice
and idle rhodomontade, which are in every one’s power who has
never known the value or undergone the labour of discovering a
single truth. Gross personal and local interests bear the principal
sway with the ignorant or mere man of the world, who considers
not what things are in themselves, but what they are to him: the
man of science attaches a higher importance to, because he finds a
more constant pleasure in the contemplation and pursuit of general
and abstracted truths. Philosophy also teaches self-knowledge; and
self-knowledge strikes equally at the root of any inordinate opinion
of ourselves, or wish to impress others with idle admiration.
Mathematicians have been remarked for persons of strict probity
and a conscientious and somewhat literal turn of mind.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c008'><sup>[16]</sup></a> But are
poets and romance-writers equally scrupulous and severe judges of
themselves, and martyrs to right principle? I cannot acquit them
of the charge of vanity, and a wish to aggrandise themselves in the
eyes of the world, at the expense of a little false complaisance
(what wonder when the world are so prone to admire, and they are
so spoiled by indulgence in self-pleasing fancies?)—but in general
they are too much taken up with their <em>ideal</em> creations, which have
also a truth and keeping of their own, to misrepresent or exaggerate
matters of fact, or to trouble their heads about them. The poet’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>waking thoughts are dreams: the liar has all his wits and senses
about him, and thinks only of astonishing his hearers by some worthless
assertion, a mixture of impudence and cunning. But what shall
we say of the clergy and the priests of all countries? Are they not
men of learning? And are they not, with few exceptions, noted for
imposture and time-serving, much more than for a love of truth and
candour? They are good subjects, it is true; bound to keep the
peace, and hired to maintain certain opinions, not to inquire into
them. So this is an exception to the rule, such as might be expected.
I speak of the natural tendencies of things, and not of the false bias
that may be given to them by their forced combination with other
principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The worst effect of this depression of spirits, or of the ‘scholar’s
melancholy,’ here spoken of, is when it leads a man, from a distrust
of himself, to seek for low company, or to forget it by matching
below himself. Gray is to be pitied, whose extreme diffidence or
fastidiousness was such as to prevent his associating with his fellow
collegians, or mingling with the herd, till at length, like the owl,
shutting himself up from society and daylight, he was hunted and
hooted at like the owl whenever he chanced to appear, and was even
assailed and disturbed in the haunts in which ‘he held his solitary
reign.’ He was driven from college to college, and subjected to a
persecution the more harassing to a person of his indolent and retired
habits. But he only shrunk the more within himself in consequence—read
over his favourite authors—corresponded with his distant
friends—was terrified out of his wits at the bare idea of having his
portrait prefixed to his works; and probably died from nervous
agitation at the publicity into which his name had been forced by
his learning, taste, and genius. This monastic seclusion and reserve
is, however, better than a career such as Porson’s; who from not
liking the restraints, or not possessing the exterior recommendations
of good society, addicted himself to the lowest indulgences, spent
his days and nights in cider-cellars and pot-houses, cared not with
whom or where he was, so that he had somebody to talk to and
something to drink, ‘from humble porter to imperial tokay’ (<em>a liquid</em>,
according to his own pun), and fell a martyr, in all likelihood, to
what in the first instance was pure <em>mauvaise honte</em>. Nothing could
overcome this propensity to low society and sotting, but the having
something to do, which required his whole attention and faculties;
and then he shut himself up for weeks together in his chambers, or
at the University, to collate old manuscripts, or edite a Greek
tragedy, or expose a grave pedant, without seeing a single boon-companion,
or touching a glass of wine. I saw him once at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>London Institution with a large patch of coarse brown paper on
his nose, the skirts of his rusty black coat hung with cobwebs, and
talking in a tone of suavity approaching to condescension to one
of the Managers. It is a pity that men should so lose themselves
from a certain awkwardness and rusticity at the outset. But did
not Sheridan make the same melancholy ending, and run the same
fatal career, though in a higher and more brilliant circle? He did;
and though not from exactly the same cause (for no one could accuse
Sheridan’s purple nose and flashing eye of a bashfulness—‘modest
as morning when she coldly eyes the youthful Phœbus!’)—yet it
was perhaps from one nearly allied to it, namely, the want of that
noble independence and confidence in its own resources which should
distinguish genius, and the dangerous ambition to get sponsors and
vouchers for it in persons of rank and fashion. The affectation
of the society of lords is as mean and low-minded as the love of that
of coblers and tapsters. It is that coblers and tapsters may admire,
that we wish to be seen in the company of <em>their</em> betters. The tone
of literary patronage is better than it was a hundred or a hundred and
fifty years ago. What dramatic author would think now of getting
a lady of quality to take a box at the first night of a play to prevent
its being damned by the pit? Do we not read the account of Parson
Adams taking his ale in Squire Booby’s kitchen with mingled
incredulity and shame? At present literature has, to a considerable
degree, found its level, and is hardly in danger, ‘deprived of its
natural patrons and protectors, the great and noble, of being trodden
in the mire, and trampled under the hoofs of a swinish multitude’—though
it can never again hope, to be what learning once was in
the persons of the priesthood, the lord and sovereign of principalities
and powers. Fool that it was ever to forego its privileges, and loosen
the strong hold it had on opinion in bigotry and superstition!</p>

<p class='c007'>I remember hearing a lady of great sense and acuteness speak of it
as a painful consequence of the natural shyness of scholars, that from
the want of a certain address, or an acquaintance with the common
forms of society, they despair of making themselves agreeable to
women of education and a certain rank in life, and throw away
their fine sentiments and romantic tenderness on chambermaids and
mantua-makers. Not daring to hope for success where it would be
most desirable, yet anxious to realise in some way the dream of
books and of their youth, they are willing to accept a return of
affection which they count upon as a tribute of gratitude in those
of lower circumstances, (as if gratitude were ever bought by interest),
and take up with the first Dulcinea del Toboso that they meet with,
when, would they only try the experiment, they might do much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>better. Perhaps so: but there is here also a mixture of pride as
well as modesty. The scholar is not only apprehensive of not
meeting with a return of fondness where it might be most advantageous
to him; but he is afraid of subjecting his self-love to the
mortification of a repulse, and to the reproach of aiming at a prize
far beyond his deserts. Besides, living (as he does) in an <em>ideal</em>
world, he has it in his option to clothe his Goddess (be she who
or what she may) with all the perfections his heart doats on; and
he works up a dowdy of this ambiguous description <em>à son gré</em>, as an
artist does a piece of dull clay, or the poet the sketch of some
unrivalled heroine. The contrast is also the greater (and not the
less gratifying as being his own discovery,) between his favourite
figure and the back-ground of her original circumstances; and he
likes her the better, inasmuch as, like himself, she owes all to her
own merit—and <em>his</em> notice!</p>

<p class='c007'>Possibly, the best cure for this false modesty, and for the uneasiness
and extravagances it occasions, would be, for the retired and
abstracted student to consider that he properly belongs to another
sphere of action, remote from the scenes of ordinary life, and may
plead the excuse of ignorance, and the privilege granted to strangers
and to those who do not speak the same language. If any one is
travelling in a foreign Diligence, he is not expected to shine nor to
put himself forward, nor need he be out of countenance because he
cannot: he has only to conform as well as he can to his new and
temporary situation, and to study common propriety and simplicity
of manners. Every thing has its own limits, a little centre of its
own, round which it moves; so that our true wisdom lies in keeping
to our own walk in life, however humble or obscure, and being
satisfied if we can succeed in it. The best of us can do no more,
and we shall only become ridiculous or unhappy by attempting it.
We are ashamed, because we are at a loss in things to which we
have no pretensions, and try to remedy our mistakes by committing
greater. An overweening vanity or self-opinion is, in truth, often
at the bottom of this weakness; and we shall be most likely to
conquer the one by eradicating the other, or restricting it within due
and moderate bounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am one of those who do not think that mankind are exactly
governed by reason or a cool calculation of consequences. I rather
believe that habit, imagination, sense, passion, prejudice, words make
a strong and frequent diversion from the right line of prudence and
wisdom. I have been told, however, that these are merely the
irregularities and exceptions, and that reason forms the rule or basis;
that the understanding, instead of being the sport of the capricious
and arbitrary decisions of the will, generally dictates the line of conduct
it is to pursue, and that self-interest, or the <em>main-chance</em>, is the
unvarying load-star of our affections, or the chief ingredient in all
our motives, that, thrown in as ballast, gives steadiness and direction
to our voyage through life. I will not take upon me to give a verdict
in this cause as judge; but I will try to plead one side of it as an
advocate, perhaps a biassed and feeble one.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the passions are said to be subject to the control of reason, and
as reason is resolved (in the present case) into an attention to our own
interest, or a practical sense of the value of money, it will not be amiss
to inquire how much of this principle itself is founded in a rational
estimate of things, or is calculated for the end it proposes, or how
much of it will turn out (when analysed) to be mere madness and folly
or a mixture, like all the rest, of obstinacy, whim, fancy, vanity, ill-nature,
and so forth, or a nominal pursuit of good. This passion, or
an inordinate love of wealth, shows itself, when it is strong, equally
in two opposite ways, in saving or in spending—in avarice (or stinginess)
and in extravagance. To examine each of their order. That
lowest and most familiar form of covetousness, commonly called
<em>stinginess</em>, is at present (it must be owned) greatly on the wane in
civilised society; it has been driven out of fashion either by ridicule
and good sense, or by the spread of luxury, or by supplying the mind
with other sources of interest, besides those which related to the bare
means of subsistence, so that it may almost be considered as a vice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>or absurdity, struck off the list, as a set-off to some that, in the change
of manners and the progress of dissipation have been brought upon
the stage. It is not, however, so entirely banished from the world,
but that examples of it may be found to our purpose. It seems to
have taken refuge in the petty provincial towns, or in old baronial castles
in the North of Scotland, where it is still triumphant. To go into
this subject somewhat in detail, as a study of the surviving manners of
the last age.—Nothing is more common in these half-starved, barren
regions, than to stint the servants in their wages, to allowance them
in the merest necessaries, never to indulge them with a morsel of
savoury food, and to lock up every thing from them as if they were
thieves, or common vagabonds, broke into the house. The natural
consequence is, that the mistresses live in continual <em>hot water</em> with
their servants, keep watch and ward over them—the pantry is in a
state of siege—grudge them every mouthful, every appearance of
comfort, or moment of leisure, and torment their own souls every
minute of their lives about what, if left wholly to itself, would not
make a difference of five shillings at the year’s end. There are
families so notorious for this kind of <em>surveillance</em> and meanness, that
no servant will go to live with them; for, to clench the matter, they
are obliged to stay if they do; as, under these amiable establishments,
and to provide against an evasion of their signal advantages, domestics
are never hired but by the half-year. Instances have been known
where servants have taken a pleasant revenge on their masters and
mistresses without intending it; but where the example of sordid
saving and meanness set to them, having taken possession of those
even who were victims to it, they have conscientiously applied it to
the benefit of all parties, and scarcely suffered a thing to enter the
house for the whole six months they stayed in it. To pass over,
however, those cases which may plead poverty as their excuse, what
shall we say to a lady of fortune (the sister of one of their old-fashioned
lairds) allowing the fruit to rot in the gardens and hot-houses
of a fine old mansion in large quantities, sooner than let any of
it be given away in presents to the neighbours; and, when peremptorily
ordered by the master of the house to send a basket-full every morning
to a sick friend, purchasing a small pottle for the purpose, and
satisfying her mind (an intelligent and well-informed one) with this
miserable subterfuge? Nay, farther, the same person, whenever they
had green-peas, or other rarities, served up at table, could hardly be
prevailed on to help the guests to them, but, if possible, sent them
away, though no other use could now be made of them, and she
would never see them again! Is there common sense in this; or is
it not more like madness? But is it not, at the same time, human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>nature? Let us stop to explain a little. In my view, the real
motive of action in this and other similar cases of grasping penuriousness
has no more reference to self-love (properly so called) than
artificial fruit and flowers have to natural ones. A certain form or
outside appearance of utility may deceive the mind, but the natural,
pulpy, wholesome, nutritious substance, the principle of vitality is
gone. To this callous, frigid habit of mind, the real uses of things
harden and crystallise; the pith and marrow are extracted out of
them, and leave nothing but the husk or shell. By a regular process,
the idea of property is gradually abstracted from the advantage it
may be of even to ourselves; and to a well-drilled, thorough-bred,
Northern housekeeper (such as I have supposed), the fruits, or
other produce of her garden, would come at last to be things no more
to be eaten or enjoyed, than her jewels or trinkets of any description,
which are, professedly, of no use but to be <em>kept</em> as symbols of wealth,
to be occasionally looked at, and carefully guarded from the approach
of any unhallowed touch. The calculation of consequences, or of
benefit to accrue to any living person, is so far from being the mainspring
in this mechanical operation that it is never once thought of, or
regarded with peevishness and impatience as an unwelcome intruder,
because it must naturally divert the mind from the warped and false
bias it has taken. The feeling of property is here, then, removed
from the sphere of practice to a chimerical and fictitious one. In
the case of not sending the fruit out of the house, there might be
some lurking idea of its being possibly wanted at home, that it might
be sent to some one else, or made up into conserves: but when
different articles of food are actually placed on the table, to hang
back from using or offering them to others, is a deliberate infatuation.
They <em>must be</em> destroyed, they <em>could not</em> appear again; and yet this
person’s heart failed her, and shrank back from the only opportunity
of making the proper use of them with a petty, sensitive apprehension,
as if it were a kind of sacrilege done to a cherished and favourite
object. The impulse to save was become, by indulgence, a sort of
desperate propensity and forlorn hope, no longer the understood
means, but the mistaken end: habit had completely superseded the
exercise and control of reason, and the rage of making the most of
every thing <em>by making no use of it at all</em>, resisted to the last moment
the shocking project of feasting on a helpless dish of green-peas (that
<em>would</em> fetch so much in the market) as an outrage against the Goddess
of stinginess, and torture to the soul of thrift! The principle of
economy is inverted; and in order to avoid the possibility of wasting
any thing, the way with such philosophers and housewives is to
abstain from touching it altogether. Is not this a common error?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Or are we conscious of our motives in such cases? [Or do we not
flatter ourselves by imputing every such act of idle folly to the necessity
of adopting some sure and judicious plan to shun ruin, beggary,
and the most profligate abuse of wealth? An old maid in the same
northern school of humanity calling upon some young ladies, her
neighbours, was so alarmed and scandalized at finding the <em>safe</em> open
in their absence, that she engaged herself to drink tea the same
afternoon, for the express purpose of reading them a lecture on the
unheard-of imprudence and impropriety of such an example, and was
mobbed on her way home by the poor servant-girl (who had been
made the subject of her declamation) in return for her uncalled-for
interference. <em>She</em> had nothing to fear, nothing to lose: <em>her</em> safe was
carefully locked up. Why then all this flutter, fidgetty anxiety, and
itch of meddling? Out of pure romantic generosity—because the
idea of any thing like comfort or liberality to a servant shocked her
economical and screwed-up prejudices as much as the impugning any
article of her religious or moral creed could have done. The very
truisms and literal refinements of this passion are then sheer impertinence.
The housekeeper came into the parlour of a ‘<em>big ha’ house</em>,’
in the same land of cakes and hospitality, to say that the workmen
had refused to eat their dinner.—‘Why so?’—Because there was
nothing but sowins and sour milk.—‘Then they must go without a
dinner,’ said the young mistress delighted; ‘there is nothing else in
the house for them.’ Yet the larder at that time groaned with cold
rounds of beef, hams, pasties, and the other plentiful remains of a
huge entertainment the day before. This was flippancy and ill-nature,
as well as a wrong notion of self-interest. Is it at all wonderful
that a decent servant-girl, when applied to to go to this place, laughed
at the idea of a service where there was nothing to eat? Yet this
attention to the <em>main-chance</em> on her part, had it come to the lady’s
knowledge, would have been treated as a great piece of insolence. So
little conception have such people of their own obligations on the
claims of others! The clergyman of the parish (prolific in this sort
of anecdote), a hearty, good sort of man enough, but irritable withal,
took it into his head to fly into a violent passion if ever he found the
glasses or spoons left out in the kitchen, and he always went into the
kitchen to look after this sort of excitement. He pretended to be
mightily afraid that the one would be broken (to his irreparable loss)
and the other stolen, though there was no danger of either: he
wanted an excuse to fret and fume about something. On the death
of his wife he sent for her most intimate friend to condole and consult
with, and having made some necessary arrangements, begged as a
peculiar favour that she would look into the kitchen to see if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>glasses and silver spoons were in their places. She repressed a smile
at such a moment out of regard to his feelings, which were serious
and acute; but burst into a fit of unrestrained laughter as soon as she
got home. So ridiculous a thing is human nature, even to ourselves!
Either our actions are absurd, or we are absurd in our constant
censure and exposure of others. I would not from choice go into
these details, but I might be required to fill up a vague outline; and
the examples of folly, spite, and meanness are unfortunately ‘sown
like a thick scurf o’er life!’]</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us turn the tables and look at the other side of this sober,
solid, ingrossing passion for property and its appendages. A man
lays out a thousand, nay, sometimes many thousand pounds in
purchasing a fine picture. This is thought, by the vulgar, a very
fantastical folly, and unaccountable waste of money. Why so? No
one would give such a sum for a picture, unless there were others
ready to offer nearly the same sum, and who are likely to appreciate
its value, and envy him the distinction. It is then a sign of taste, a
proof of wealth to possess it, it is an ornament and a luxury. If the
same person lays out the same sum of money in building or purchasing
a fine house, or enriching it with costly furniture, no notice is taken—this
is supposed to be perfectly natural and in order. Yet both
are equally gratuitous pieces of extravagance, and the value of the
objects is, in either case, equally <em>ideal</em>. It will be asked, ‘But what
is the use of the picture?’ And what, pray, is the use of the fine
house or costly furniture, unless to be looked at, to be admired, and
to display the taste and magnificence of the owner? Are not pictures
and statues as much furniture as gold plate or jasper tables; or does
the circumstance of the former having a meaning in them, and appealing
to the imagination as well as to the senses, neutralize their virtue,
and render it entirely chimerical and visionary? It is true, every
one must have a house of some kind, furnished somehow, and the
superfluity so far grows imperceptibly out of the necessary. But a
fine house, fine furniture, is necessary to no man, nor of more value
than the plainest, except as a matter of taste, of fancy, of luxury
and ostentation. Again, no doubt, if a person is in the habit of
keeping a number of servants, and entertaining a succession of fashionable
guests, he must have more room than he wants for himself,
apartments suitably decorated to receive them, and offices and stables
for their horses and retinue. But is all this unavoidably dictated as
a consequence of his attention to the <em>main-chance</em>, or is it not sacrificing
the latter, and making it a stalking-horse to his vanity, dissipation, or
love of society and hospitality? We are at least as fond of spending
money as of making it. If a man runs through a fortune in the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>here spoken of, is it out of love to himself? Yet who scruples to
run through a fortune in this way, or accuses himself of any extraordinary
disinterestedness or love of others? One bed is as much as
any one can sleep in, one room is as much as he can dine in, and he
may have another for study or to retire to after dinner—but he can
only want more than this for the accommodation of his friends, or
the admiration of strangers. At Fonthill Abbey (to take an extreme
illustration), there was not a single room fit to sit, lie, or stand in:
the whole was cut up into pigeon holes, or spread out into long
endless galleries. The building this huge, ill-assorted pile cost, I
believe, nearly a million of money; and if the circumstance was
mentioned, it occasioned an expression of surprise at the amount of
the wealth that had been thus squandered—but if it was said that a
hundred pounds had been laid out on a highly-finished picture, there
was the same astonishment expressed at its misdirection. The
sympathetic auditor makes up his mind to the first and greatest loss,
by reflecting that in case of the worst the building materials alone
will fetch something considerable; or, in the very idea of stone-walls
and mortar there is something solid and tangible, that repels the
charge of frivolous levity or fine sentiment. This quaint excrescence
in architecture, preposterous and ill-contrived as it was, occasioned,
I suspect, many a heart-ache and bitter comparison to the throng of
fashionable visitants; and I conceive it was the very want of comfort
and convenience that enhanced this feeling, by magnifying, as it
were from contrast, the expense that had been incurred in realising
an idle whim. When we judge thus perversely and invidiously of
the employment of wealth by others, I cannot think that we are
guided in our own choice of means to ends by a simple calculation of
downright use and personal accommodation. The gentleman who
purchased Fonthill, and was supposed to be possessed of wealth
enough to purchase half a dozen more Fonthills, lived there himself
for some time in a state of the greatest retirement, rose at six and
read till four, rode out for an hour for the benefit of the air, and
dined abstemiously for the sake of his health. I could do all this
myself. What then became of the rest of his fortune? It was lying
in the funds, or embarked in business to make it yet greater, that he
might still rise at six and read till four, &#38;c.—it was of no other
earthly use to him; for he did not wish to make a figure in the world,
or to throw it away on studs of horses, on equipages, entertainments,
gaming, electioneering, subscriptions to charitable institutions, [mistresses,]
or any of the usual fashionable modes of squandering wealth
for the amusement and wonder of others and our own fancied enjoyment.
Mr. F. did not probably lay out five hundred a-year on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>himself: it cost Mr. Beckford, who led a life of perfect seclusion,
twenty thousand a-year to defray the expenses of his table and of his
household establishment. When I find that such and so various are
the tastes of men, I am a little puzzled to know what is meant by
self-interest, of which some persons talk so fluently, as if it was a
<em>Jack-in-a-Box</em> which they could take out and show you, and which
they tell you is the object that all men equally aim at. If money, is
it for its own sake or the sake of other things? Is it to hoard it or
to spend it, on ourselves or others? In all these points, we find
the utmost diversity and contradiction both of feeling and practice.
Certainly, he who puts his money into a strong-box, and he who puts
it into a dice-box must be allowed to have a very different idea of
the <em>main-chance</em>. If by this phrase be understood a principle of
self-preservation, I grant that while we live, we must not starve, and
that <em>necessity has no law</em>. Beyond this point, all seems nearly
left to chance or whim; and so far are all the world from being
agreed in their definition of this redoubtable term, that one half of
them may be said to think and act in diametrical opposition to the
other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Avarice is the miser’s dream, as fame is the poet’s. A calculation
of physical profit or loss is almost as much out of the question in the
one case as in the other. The one has set his mind on gold, the
other on praise, as the <em>summum bonum</em> or object of his bigoted idolatry
and darling contemplation, not for any private and sinister ends. It
is the immediate pursuit, not the remote or reflex consequence that
gives wings to the passion. There is, indeed, a reference to self in
either case that fixes and concentrates it, but not a gross or sordid
one. Is not the desire to accumulate and leave a vast estate behind
us equally romantic with the desire to leave a posthumous name
behind us? Is not the desire of distinction, of something to be known
and remembered by, the paramount consideration? And are not the
privations we undergo, the sacrifices and exertions we make for either
object, nearly akin? A child makes a huge snow-ball to show his
skill and perseverance and as something to wonder at, not that he
can swallow it as an ice, or warm his hands at it, and though the next
day’s sun will dissolve it; and the man accumulates a pile of wealth
for the same reason principally, or to find employment for his time,
his imagination, and his will. I deny that it can be of any other use
to him to watch and superintend the returns of millions, than to watch
the returns of the heavenly bodies, or to calculate their distances, or
to contemplate eternity, or infinity, or the sea, or the dome of St.
Peter’s, or any other object that excites curiosity and interest from
its magnitude and importance. Do we not look at the most barren
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>mountain with thrilling awe and wonder? And is it strange that we
should gaze at a mountain of gold with satisfaction, when we can
besides say, ‘This is ours, with all the power that belongs to it?’
Every passion, however plodding and prosaic, has its poetical side to
it. A miser is the true alchemist, or, like the magician in his cell,
who overlooks a mighty experiment, who sees dazzling visions, and
who wields the will of others at his nod; but to whom all other
hopes and pleasures are dead, and who is cut off from all connexion
with his kind. He lives in a splendid hallucination, a waking
trance, and so far it is well: but if he thinks he has any other need
or use for all this endless store (any more than to swill the ocean)
he deceives himself, and is no conjuror after all. He goes on, however,
mechanically adding to his stock, and fancying that great
riches is great gain, that every particle that swells the heap is something
in reserve against the evil day, and a defence against that
poverty which he dreads more, the farther he is removed from it;
as the more giddy the height to which we have attained, the more
frightful does the gulph yawn below—so easily does habit get the
mastery of reason, and so nearly is passion allied to madness! ‘But
he is laying up for his heirs and successors.’ In toiling for them,
and sacrificing himself, is he properly attending to the <em>main-chance</em>?</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the turn the love of money takes in cautious, dry, recluse,
and speculative minds. If it were the pure and abstract love of
money, it could take no other turn but this. But in a different class
of characters, the sociable, the vain, and imaginative, it takes just the
contrary one, <em>viz.</em> to expense, extravagance, and ostentation. It
then loves to display itself in every fantastic shape and with every
reflected lustre, in houses, in equipage, in dress, in a retinue of friends
and dependants, in horses, in hounds—to glitter in the eye of fashion,
to be echoed by the roar of folly, and buoyed up for a while like a
bubble on the surface of vanity, to sink all at once and irrecoverably
into an abyss of ruin and bankruptcy. Does it foresee this result?
Does it care for it? What then becomes of the calculating principle
that can neither be hoodwinked nor bribed from its duty? Does it
do nothing for us in this critical emergency? It is blind, deaf, and
insensible to all but the noise, confusion, and glare of objects by
which it is fascinated and lulled into a fatal repose! One man ruins
himself by the vanity of associating with lords, another by his love
of low company, one by his fondness for building, another by his
rage for keeping open house and private theatricals, one by philosophical
experiments, another by embarking in every ticklish and
fantastic speculation that is proposed to him, one throws away an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>estate on a law-suit, another on a die, a third on a horse-race, a
fourth on <em>virtù</em>, a fifth on a drab, a sixth on a contested election,
&#38;c. There is no dearth of instances to fill the page, or complete
the group of profound calculators and inflexible martyrs to the <em>main-chance</em>.
Let any of these discreet and well-advised persons have the
veil torn from their darling follies by experience, and be gifted with
a double share of wisdom and a second fortune to dispose of, and
each of them, so far from being warned by experience or disaster,
will only be the more resolutely bent to assert the independence of
his choice, and throw it away the self-same road it went before, on
his vanity in associating with lords, on his love of low company, on
his fondness for building, on his rage for keeping open house or
private theatricals, on philosophical experiments, on fantastic speculations,
on a law-suit, on a dice-box, on a favourite horse, on a picture,
on a mistress, or election contest, and so on, through the whole of
the chapter of accidents and cross-purposes. There is an admirable
description of this sort of infatuation with folly and ruin in Madame
D’Arblay’s account of Harrel in ‘Cecilia;’ and though the picture
is highly wrought and carried to the utmost length, yet I maintain
that the principle is common. I myself have known more than one
individual in the same predicament; and therefore cannot think that
the deviations from the line of strict prudence and wisdom are so
rare or trifling as the theory I am opposing represents them, or I
must have been singularly unfortunate in my acquaintance. Out of
a score of persons of this class I could mention several that have
ruined their fortunes out of mere freak, others that are in a state of
dotage and imbecility for fear of being robbed of all they are worth.
The rest care nothing about the matter. So that this boasted and
unfailing attention to the <em>main-chance</em> resolves itself, when strong, into
mad profusion or griping penury, or if weak, is null and yields to
other motives. Such is the conclusion, to which my observation of
life has led me: if I am quite wrong, it is hard that in a world
abounding in such characters I should not have met with a single
practical philosopher.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c008'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A girl in a country-town resolves never to marry any one under
a duke or a lord. Good. This may be very well as an ebullition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>of spleen or vanity; but is there much common sense or regard to
her own satisfaction in it? Were there any likelihood of her succeeding
in her resolution, she would not make it: for it is the very distinction
to be attained that piques her ambition, and leads her to
gratify her conceit of herself by affecting to look down on any lower
matches. Let her suffer ever so much mortification or chagrin in
the prosecution of her scheme, it only confirms her the more in it:
the spirit of contradiction, and the shame of owning herself defeated,
increase with every new disappointment and year of painful probation.
At least this is the case while there is any chance left.
But what, after all, is this haughty and ridiculous pretension founded
on? Is it owing to a more commanding view and a firmer grasp of
consequences, or of her own interest? No such thing: she is as
much captivated by the fancied sound of ‘my lady,’ and dazzled by
the image of a coronet-coach, as the girl who marries a footman is
smit with his broad shoulders, laced coat, and rosy cheeks. ‘But
why must I be always in extremes? Few misses make vows of
celibacy or marry their footmen.’ Take then the broad question:—Do
they generally marry from the convictions of the understanding,
or make the choice that is most likely to ensure their future happiness,
or that they themselves approve afterwards? I think the answer
must be in the negative; and yet love and marriage are among the
weightiest and most serious concerns of life. Mutual regard, good
temper, good sense, good character, or a conformity of tastes and
dispositions, have notoriously and lamentably little to say in it. On
the contrary, it is most frequently those things that pique and provoke
opposition, instead of those which promise concord and sympathy,
that decide the choice and inflame the will by the love of conquest
or of overcoming difficulty. Or it is a complexion, or a fine set of
teeth, or air, or dress, or a fine person, or false calves, or affected
consequence, or a reputation for gallantry, or a flow of spirits, or
a flow of words, or forward coquetry, or assumed indifference,
something that appeals to the senses, the fancy, or to our pride, and
determines us to throw away our happiness for life. Neither in this
case, on which so much depends, are the <em>main-chance</em> and our real
interest by any means the same thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Or take the passion of love where it has other objects and consequences
in view. Is reason any match for the poison of this
passion, where it has been once imbibed? I might just as well be
told that reason is a cure for madness or the bite of a venomous
serpent. Are not health, fortune, friends, character, peace of mind,
every thing sacrificed to its idlest impulse? Are the instances rare,
or are they not common and tragical? The <em>main-chance</em> does not
serve the turn here. Does the prospect of certain ruin break the
fascination to its frail victim, or does it not rather enhance and precipitate
the result? Or does it not render the conquest more easy and
secure that the seducer has already triumphed over and deserted a
hundred other victims? A man <em>à bonnes fortunes</em> is the most
irresistible personage in the lists of gallantry. Take drunkenness
again, that vice which till within these few years (and even still) was
fatal to the health, the constitution, the fortunes of so many individuals,
and the peace of so many families in Great Britain. I would ask
what remonstrance of friends, what lessons of experience, what
resolutions of amendment, what certainty of remorse and suffering,
however exquisite, would deter the confirmed sot (where the passion
for this kind of excitement had once become habitual and the
immediate want of it was felt) from indulging his propensity and
taking his full swing, notwithstanding the severe and imminent punishment
to follow upon his incorrigible excess? The consequence of
not abstaining from his favourite beverage is not doubtful and distant
(a thing in the clouds) but close at his side, staring him in the face,
and felt perhaps in all its aggravations the very morning, yet the
recollection of this and of the next day’s dawn is of no avail against
the momentary craving and headlong impulse given by the first
application of the glass to his lips. The present temptation is indeed
heightened by the threatened alternative. I know this as a rule, that
the stronger the repentance, the surer the relapse and the more
hopeless the cure! The being engrossed by the present moment, by
the present feeling, whatever it be, whether of pleasure or pain, is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>evident cause of both. Few instances have been heard of, of a final
reformation on this head. Yet it is a clear case; and reason, if it
were that Giant that it is represented in any thing but ledgers and
books of accounts, would put down the abuse in an instant. It is
true, this infirmity is more particularly chargeable to the English and
to other Northern nations, and there has been a considerable improvement
among us of late years; but I suspect it is owing to a change of
manners, and to the opening of new sources of amusement (without
the aid of ardent spirits flung in to relieve the depression of our
animal spirits,) more than to the excellent treatises which have been
written against the ‘Use of Fermented Liquors,’ or to an increasing,
tender regard to our own comfort, health, and happiness in the breast
of individuals. We still find plenty of ways of tormenting ourselves
and sporting with the feelings of others! I will say nothing of a
passion for gaming here, as too obvious an illustration of what I mean.
It is more rare, and hardly to be looked on as epidemic with us.
But few that have dabbled in this vice have not become deeply
involved, and few (or none) that have done so have ever retraced
their steps or returned to sober calculations of the <em>main-chance</em>. The
majority, it is true, are not gamesters; but where the passion does
exist, it completely tyrannizes over and stifles the voice of common
sense, reason, and humanity. How many victims has the point of
honour! I will not pretend that, as matters stand, it may not be
necessary to fight a duel, under certain circumstances and on certain
provocations, even in a prudential point of view, (though this again
proves how little the maxims and practices of the world are regulated
by a mere consideration of personal safety and welfare)—but I do
say that the rashness with which this responsibility is often incurred,
and the even seeking for trifling causes of quarrel, shows any thing
but a consistent regard to self-interest as a general principle of action,
or rather betrays a total recklessness of consequences, when opposed
to pique, petulance, or passion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before I proceed to answer a principal objection (and indeed a
staggering one at first sight) I will mention here that I think it
strongly confirms my view of human nature, that men form their
opinions much more from prejudice than reason. The proof that
they do so is that they form such opposite ones, when the abstract
premises and independent evidence are the same. How few Calvinists
become Lutherans! How few Papists Protestants! How few
Tories Whigs!<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c008'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Each shuts his eyes equally to facts or arguments,
and persists in the view of the subject that custom, pride, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>obstinacy dictate. Interest is no more regarded than reason; for it
is often at the risk both of life and fortune that these opinions have
been maintained, and it is uniformly when parties have run highest
and the strife has been deadliest that people have been most forward
to stake their existence and every thing belonging to them, on some
unintelligible dogma or article of an old-fashioned creed. Half the
wars and fightings, martyrdoms, persecutions, feuds, antipathies, heart-burnings
in the world have been about some distinction, ‘some trick
not worth an egg’—so ready are mankind to sacrifice their all to a
mere name! It may be urged, that the good of our souls or our
welfare in a future state of being is a rational and well-grounded
motive for these religious extravagances. And this is true, so far as
religious zeal falls in with men’s passions or the spirit of the times.
A bigot was formerly ready to cut his neighbour’s throat to go to
Heaven, but not so ready to reform his own life, or give up a single
vice or gratification for all the pains and penalties denounced upon it,
and of which his faith in Holy Church did not suffer him to doubt
a moment!</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is contended here, that in matters not of doctrinal speculation
but of private life and domestic policy, every one consults and
understands his own interest; that whatever other <em>hobbies</em> he may
have, he minds this as the main object, and contrives to make both
ends meet, in spite of seeming inattention and real difficulties. ‘If
we look around us’ (says a shrewd, hard-headed Scotchman) ‘and
take examples from the neighbourhood in which we live, we shall
find that allowing for occasional exceptions, diversities and singularities,
the <em>main-chance</em> is still stuck to with rigid and unabated pertinacity—the
accounts are wound up and every thing is right at the year’s end,
whatever freaks or fancies may have intervened in the course of it.
The business of life goes on (which is the principal thing) and every
man’s house stands on its own bottom. This is the case in Nicholson-street,
in the next street to it, and in the next street to that, and
in the whole of Edinburgh, Scotland, and England to boot.’ This,
I allow, is a <em>home-thrust</em>, and I must parry it, how I can. It is a
kind of heavy, broad-wheeled waggon of an objection that makes a
formidable, awkward appearance, and takes up so much of the road,
that I shall have a lucky escape if I can dash by it in my light travelling
gig without being upset or crushed to atoms. The persons who in the
present instance have the charge of it, in its progress through the
streets of Edinburgh, are a constitutional lawyer, a political economist,
an opposition editor, and an <em>ex-officio</em> surveyor of the Customs—fearful
odds against one poor metaphysician! Their machine of human
life, I confess, puts me a little in mind of those square-looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>caravans one sometimes meets on the road in which they transport
wild beasts from place to place; and dull, heavy, safe, and flat as
they look, the inmates continue their old habits, the monkeys play
their tricks, and the panthers lick their jaws for human blood, though
cramped and confined in their excursions. So the vices and follies,
when they cannot break loose, do their worst <em>inside</em> this formal
conveyance, the <em>main-chance</em>. As this ovation is to pass up High-street,
for the honour of the Scottish capital, I should wish it to
stop at the shop-door of Mr. Bartholine Saddletree, to see if he is
at home or in the courts. Also, to inquire whether the suit of Peter
Peebles is yet ended; and to take the opinion of counsel, how many
of the Highland lairds or Scottish noblemen and gentlemen that were
out in the fifteen and the forty-five, perilled their lives and fortunes
in the good cause from an eye to the <em>main-chance</em>? The Baron of
Bradwardine would have scorned such a suggestion; nay, it would
have been below Balmawhapple or even Killancureit. But ‘the age
of chivalry is gone, and that of sophists, economists, and calculators
has succeeded.’ I should say that the risk, the secrecy, the possibility
of the leaders having their heads stuck on Temple-Bar, and
their estates confiscated, were among the foremost causes that inflamed
their zeal and stirred their blood to the enterprise. Hardship,
danger, exile, death,—these words ‘smack of honour,’ more than the
<em>main-chance</em>. The modern Scotch may be loyal on this thriving
principle: their ancestors found <em>their</em> loyalty a very losing concern.
Yet they persevered in it till and long after it became a desperate
cause. But patriotism and loyalty (true or false) are important and
powerful principles in human affairs, though not always selfish and
calculating. Honour is one great standard-bearer and puissant leader
in the struggle of human life; and less than honour (a nickname or a
bugbear) is enough to set the multitude together by the ears, whether
in civil, religious, or private brawls. [But to return to our Edinburgh
shop-keepers, those practical models of wisdom, and authentic epitomes
of human nature. Say that by their ‘canny ways and pawky looks’
they keep their names out of the ‘Gazette,’ yet still care (not the
less perhaps) mounts behind their counters, and sits in their back-shops.
A tradesman is not a bankrupt at the year’s end. But what
does it signify, if he is hen-pecked in the mean time, or quarrels with
his wife, or beats his apprentices, or has married a woman twice as
old as himself for her money, or has been jilted by his maid, or
fuddles himself every night, or is laying in an apoplexy by overeating
himself, or is believed by nobody, or is a furious Whig or
Tory, or a knave, or a fool, or one envious of the success of his
neighbours, or dissatisfied with his own, or surly, or eaten up with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>indolence and procrastination, never easy but bashful and awkward in
company (though with a vast desire to shine) or has some personal
defect or weak side on which the Devil is sure to assail him, and the
venting his spleen and irritability on which, through some loop-hole
or other, makes the real business and torment of his life—that of his
shop may go on as it pleases. Such is the perfection of reason and
the triumph of the sovereign good, where there are no strong passions
to disturb, or no great vices to sully it! The humours collect, the
will will have head, the petty passions ferment, and we start some
grievance or other, and hunt it down every hour in the day, or the
machine of <em>still-life</em> could not go on even in North Britain. But were
I to grant the full force and extent of the objection, I should still
say that it does not bear upon my view of the subject or general
assertion, that reason is an unequal match for passion. Business is
a kind of gaoler or task-master, that keeps its vassals in good order
while they are under its eye, as the slave or culprit performs his task
with the whip hanging over him, and punishment immediately to
follow neglect; but the question is, what he would do with his
recovered freedom, or what course the mind will for the most part
pursue, when in the range of its general conduct it has its choice to
make between a distant, doubtful, sober, rational good (or <em>average</em>
state of being), and some one object of comparatively little value,
that strikes the senses, flatters our pride, gives scope to the imagination,
and has all the strength of passion and inclination on its side.
The <em>main-chance</em> then is a considerable exception, but not a fair one or
a case in point, since it falls under a different head and line of
argument.] The fault of reason in general, (which takes in the
<em>whole</em> instead of <em>parts</em>,) is that objects, though of the utmost extent
and importance, are not defined and tangible. This fault cannot
be found with the pursuit of trade and commerce. It is not a
mere dry, abstract, undefined, speculative, however steady and
well-founded conviction of the understanding. It has other levers
and pulleys to enforce it, besides those of reason and reflection. As
follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The value of money is positive or specific. The interest in it
is a sort of mathematical interest, reducible to number and quantity.
Ten is always more than one; a part is never greater than the whole;
the good we seek or attain in this way has a technical denomination,
and I do not deny that in matters of strict calculation, the principle
of calculation will naturally bear great sway. The returns of profit
and loss are regular and mechanical, and the operations of business, or
the <em>main-chance</em>, are so too. But, commonly speaking, we judge by
the <em>degree</em> of excitement, not by the ultimate quantity. Thus we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>prefer a draught of nectar to the recovery of our health, [and are on
most occasions ready to exclaim,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘An ounce of sweet is worth a pound of sour.’]</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Yet there is a point at which self-will and humour stop. A man will
take brandy, which is a <em>kind of slow poison</em>, but he will not take
<em>actual</em> poison, knowing it to be such, however slow the operation or
bewitching the taste; because here the effect is absolutely fixed and
certain, not variable, nor in the power of the imagination to elude or
trifle with it. I see no courage in battle, but in going on what is
called the <em>forlorn hope</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Business is also an affair of habit: it calls for incessant and
daily application; and what was at first a matter of necessity to
supply our wants, becomes often a matter of necessity to employ our
time. The man of business wants work for his head; the labourer
and mechanic for his hands; so that the love of action, of difficulty
and competition, the stimulus of success or failure, is perhaps as
strong an ingredient in men’s ordinary pursuits as the love of gain.
We find persons pursuing science, or any <em>hobby-horsical</em> whim or
handicraft that they have taken a fancy to, or persevering in a losing
concern, with just the same ardour and obstinacy. As to the choice
of a pursuit in life, a man may not be forward to engage in business,
but being once in, does not like to turn back amidst the pity of friends
and the derision of enemies. How difficult is it to prevent those
who have a turn for any art or science from going into these
unprofitable pursuits! Nay, how difficult is it often to prevent those
who have no turn that way, but prefer starving to a certain income!
If there is one in a family brighter than the rest, he is immediately
designed for one of the learned professions. Really, the dull and
plodding people of the world have not much reason to boast of their
superior wisdom or numbers: they are in an involuntary majority!</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The value of money is an <em>exchangeable</em> value: that is, this
pursuit is available towards and convertible into a great many others.
A person is in want of money, and mortgages an estate, to throw it
away upon a round of entertainments and company. The passion or
motive here is not a hankering after money, but society, and the
individual will ruin himself for this object. Another, who has the
same passion for show and a certain style of living, tries to gain a
fortune in trade to indulge it, and only goes to work in a more
round-about way. I remember a story of a common mechanic at
Manchester, who laid out the hard-earned savings of the week in
hiring a horse and livery-servant to ride behind him to Stockport every
Sunday, and to dine there at an ordinary like a gentleman. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>pains bestowed upon the <em>main-chance</em> here was only a cover for another
object, which exercised a ridiculous predominance over his mind.
Money will purchase a horse, a house, a picture, leisure, dissipation,
or whatever the individual has a fancy for that is to be purchased;
but it does not follow that he is fond of all these, or of whatever will
promote his real interest, because he is fond of money, but that he has
a passion for some one of these objects, to which he would probably
sacrifice all the rest, and his own peace and happiness into the bargain.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The <em>main-chance</em> is an instrument of various passions, but is
directly opposed to none of them, with the single exception of
indolence or the <em>vis inertiæ</em>, which of itself is seldom strong enough
to master it, without the aid of some other incitement. A barrister
sticks to his duty as long as he has only his love of ease to prevent;
but he flings up his briefs, or neglects them, if he thinks he can
make a figure in Parliament. [A servant-girl stays in her place and
does her work, though perhaps lazy and slatternly, because no
immediate temptation occurs strong enough to interfere with the
necessity of gaining her bread, but she goes away with a bastard-child,
because here passion and desire come into play, though
the consequence is that she loses not only her place, but her
character and every prospect in life.] No one flings away the <em>main-chance</em>
without a motive, any more than he voluntarily walks into the
fire or breaks his neck out of window. A man must live; the first
step is a point of necessity: every man would live well; the second is
a point of luxury. The having, or even acquiring wealth does not
prevent our enjoying it in various ways. A man may give his
mornings to business, and his evenings to pleasure. There is no
contradiction; nor does he sacrifice his ruling passion by this, any
more than the man of letters by study, or the soldier by an attention
to discipline. Reason and passion are opposed, not passion and
business. The sot, the glutton, the debauchee, the gamester, must all
have money, to make their own use of it, and they may indulge all
these passions and their avarice at the same time. It is only when
the last becomes the ruling passion that it puts a prohibition on the
others. In that case, every thing else is lost sight of; but it is
seldom carried to this length, or when it is, it is far from being
another name, either in its means or ends, for reason, sense, or
happiness, as I have already shown.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have taken no notice hitherto of ambition or virtue, or scarcely
of the pursuits of fame or intellect. Yet all these are important and
respectable divisions of the map of human life. Who ever charged
Mr. Pitt with a want of common sense, because he did not die worth
a plum? Had it been proposed to Lord Byron to forfeit every penny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>of his estate, or every particle of his reputation, would he have
hesitated to part with the former? Is there not a loss of character,
a stain upon honour, that is felt as a severer blow than any reverse of
fortune? Do not the richest heiresses in the city marry for a title,
and think themselves well off? Are there not patriots who think or
dream all their lives about their country’s good; philanthropists who
rave about liberty and humanity at a certain yearly loss? Are there
not studious men, who never once thought of bettering their circumstances?
Are not the liberal professions held more respectable than
business, though less lucrative? Might not most people do better
than they do, but that they postpone their interest to their indolence,
their taste for reading, their love of pleasure, or other pursuits?
And is it not generally understood that all men can make a fortune or
succeed in the <em>main-chance</em>, who have but that one idea in their heads?<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c008'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
Lastly, are there not those who pursue or husband wealth for their
own good, for the benefit of their friends or the relief of the distressed?
But as the examples are rare, and might be supposed to make against
myself, I shall not insist upon them. I think I have said enough to
vindicate or apologize for my first position—</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The New Monthly Magazine.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>October and December, 1828.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'><em>A.</em> For my part, I think Helvetius has made it clear that self-love
is at the bottom of all our actions, even of those which are apparently
the most generous and disinterested.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> I do not know what you mean by saying that Helvetius has
made this clear, nor what you mean by self-love.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Why, was not he the first who explained to the world that in
gratifying others, we gratify ourselves; that though the result may be
different, the motive is really the same, and a selfish one; and that
if we had not more pleasure in performing what are called friendly
or virtuous actions than the contrary, they would never enter our
thoughts?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span><em>B.</em> Certainly he is no more entitled to this discovery (if it be one)
than you are. Hobbes and Mandeville long before him asserted the
same thing in the most explicit and unequivocal manner;<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c008'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and
Butler, in the Notes and Preface to his Sermons, had also long
before answered it in the most satisfactory way.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Ay, indeed! pray how so?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> By giving the <em>common sense</em> answer to the question which I
have just asked of you.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> And what is that? I do not exactly comprehend.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Why, that self-love means, both in common and philosophical
speech, the love <em>of</em> self.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> To be sure, <em>there needs no ghost to tell us that</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> And yet, simple as it is, both you and many great philosophers
seem to have overlooked it.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> You are pleased to be obscure—unriddle for the sake of the
vulgar.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Well then, Bishop Butler’s statement in the volume I have
mentioned——</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> May I ask, is it the author of the <cite>Analogy</cite> you speak of?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> The same, but an entirely different and much more valuable
work. His position is, that the arguments of the opposite party go
to prove that in all our motives and actions it is the individual indeed
who loves or is interested in <em>something</em>, but not in the smallest
degree (which yet seems necessary to make out the full import of
the compound ‘sound significant,’ <em>self-love</em>) that that something is
<em>himself</em>. By self-love is surely implied not only that it is I who feel
a certain passion, desire, good-will, and so forth, but that I feel this
good-will towards myself—in other words, that I am both the person
feeling the attachment, and the object of it. In short, the controversy
between self-love and benevolence relates not to the person
who loves, but to the person beloved—otherwise, it is flat and puerile
nonsense. There must always be some one to feel the love, that’s
certain, or else there could be no love of one thing or another—so
far there can be no question that it is a given individual who feels,
thinks, and acts in all possible cases of feeling, thinking, and acting—‘there
needs,’ according to your own allusion, ‘no ghost come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>from the grave to tell us that’—but whether the said individual in so
doing always thinks <em>of</em>, feels <em>for</em>, and acts <em>with a view to himself</em>,
that is a very important question, and the only real one at issue; and
the very statement of which, in a distinct and intelligible form, gives
at once the proper and inevitable answer to it. Self-love, to mean
any thing, must have a double meaning, that is, must not merely
signify love, but love defined and directed in a particular manner,
having <em>self</em> for its object, reflecting and reacting upon <em>self</em>; but it is
downright and intolerable trifling to persist that the love or concern
which we feel for another still has self for its object, because it is we
who feel it. The same sort of quibbling would lead to the conclusion
that when I am thinking of any other person, I am notwithstanding
thinking of myself, because it is <em>I</em> who have his image in my
mind.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> I cannot, I confess, see the connection.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> I wish you would point out the distinction. Or let me ask
you—Suppose you were to observe me looking frequently and
earnestly at myself in the glass, would you not be inclined to laugh,
and say that this was vanity?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> I might be half-tempted to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Well; and if you were to find me admiring a fine picture, or
speaking in terms of high praise of the person or qualities of another,
would you not set it down equally to an excess of coxcombry and
self-conceit?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> How, in the name of common sense, should I do so?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Nay, how should you do otherwise upon your own principles?
For if sympathy with another is to be construed into self-love because
it is I who feel it, surely, by the same rule, my admiration and praise
of another must be resolved into self-praise and self-admiration, and I
am the whole time delighted with myself, to wit, with my own
thoughts and feelings, while I pretend to be delighted with another.
Another’s limbs are as much mine, who contemplate them, as his
feelings.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Now, my good friend, you go too far: I can’t think you serious.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Do I not tell you that I have a most grave Bishop (equal to a
whole Bench) on my side?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> What! is this illustration of the looking-glass and picture his?
I thought it was in your own far-fetched manner.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> And why far-fetched?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Because nobody can think of calling the praise of another self-conceit—the
words have a different meaning in the language.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Nobody has thought of confounding them hitherto, and yet
they sound to me as like as selfishness and generosity. If our vanity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>can be brought to admire others disinterestedly, I do not see but our
good-nature may be taught to serve them as disinterestedly. Grant
me but this, that self-love signifies not simply, ‘I love,’ but requires to
have this further addition, ‘I love <em>myself</em>.’ understood in order to make
sense or grammar of it, and I defy you to make one or the other of
Helvetius’s theory, if you will needs have it to be his. If, as
Fielding says, all our passions are selfish merely because they are
<em>ours</em>, then in hating another we must be said to hate ourselves, just as
wisely as in loving another, we are said to be actuated by self-love. I
have no patience with such foolery. I respect that fine old sturdy
fellow Hobbes, or even the acute pertinacious sophistry of Mandeville;
but I do not like the flimsy, self-satisfied repetition of an
absurdity, which with its originality has lost all its piquancy.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> You have, I know, very little patience with others who differ
from you, nor are you a very literal reporter of the arguments of
those who happen to be on your side of the question. You were
about to tell me the substance of Butler’s answer to Helvetius’s
theory, if we can let the anachronism pass; and I have as yet only
heard certain quaint and verbal distinctions of your own. I must
still think that the most disinterested actions proceed from a selfish
motive. A man feels distress at the sight of a beggar, and he parts
with his money to remove this uneasiness. If he did not feel this
distress in his own mind, he would take no steps to relieve the other’s
wants.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> And pray, does he feel this distress in his own mind out of
love to himself, or solely that he may have the pleasure of getting rid
of it? The first <em>move</em> in the game of mutual obligation is evidently a
social, not a selfish impulse, and I might rest the dispute here and
insist upon going no farther till this step is got over, but it is not
necessary. I have already told you the substance of Butler’s answer
to this common-place and plausible objection. He says, in his fine
broad manly and yet unpretending mode of stating a question, that a
living being may be supposed to be actuated either by mere sensations,
having no reference to any one else, or else that having an idea and
foresight of the consequences to others, he is influenced by and
interested in those consequences only in so far as they have a distinct
connexion with his own ultimate good, in both which cases, seeing
that the motives and actions have both their origin and end in self,
they may and must be properly denominated <em>selfish</em>. But where the
motive is neither physically nor morally selfish, that is, where the
impulse to act is neither excited by a physical sensation nor by a
reflection on the consequence to accrue to the individual, it must be
hard to say in what sense it can be called so, except in that sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>already exploded, namely, that which would infer that an impulse of
any kind is selfish merely because it acts upon some one, or that
before we can entertain disinterested sympathy with another, we must
feel no sympathy at all. Benevolence, generosity, compassion, friendship,
&#38;c. imply, says the Bishop, that we take an immediate and
unfeigned interest in the welfare of others; that their pleasures give
us pleasure; that their pains give us pain, barely to know of them,
and from no thought about ourselves. But no! retort the advocates
of self-love, this is not enough: before any person can pretend to the
title of benevolent, generous, and so on, he must prove, that so far
from taking the deepest and most heartfelt interest in the happiness of
others, he has no feeling on the subject, that he is perfectly indifferent
to their weal or woe; and then taking infinite pains and making
unaccountable sacrifices for their good without caring one farthing
about them, he might pass for heroic and disinterested. But if he
lets it appear he has the smallest good-will towards them and acts
upon it, he then becomes a merely selfish agent; so that to establish a
character for generosity, compassion, humanity, &#38;c. in any of his
actions, he must first plainly prove that he never felt the slightest
twinge of any of these passions thrilling in his bosom. This, according
to my author, is requiring men to act not from charitable motives,
but from no motives at all. Such reasoning has not an appearance of
philosophy, but rather of drivelling weakness or of tacit irony. For
my part, I can conceive of no higher strain of generosity than that
which justly and truly says, <i><span lang="la">Nihil humani â me alienum puto</span></i>—but,
according to your modern French friends and my old English ones,
there is no difference between this and the most sordid selfishness;
for the instant a man takes an interest in another’s welfare, he makes
it his own, and all the merit and disinterestedness is gone. ‘Greater
love than this hath no man, that he should give his life for his friend.’
It must be rather a fanciful sort of self-love that at any time sacrifices
its own acknowledged and obvious interests for the sake of another.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Not in the least. The expression you have just used explains
the whole mystery, and I think you must allow this yourself. The
moment I sympathise with another, I do in strictness make his
interest my own. The two things on this supposition become inseparable,
and my gratification is identified with his advantage.
Every one, in short, consults his particular taste and inclination,
whatever may be its bias, or acts from the strongest motive.
Regulus, as Helvetius has so ably demonstrated, would not have
returned to Carthage, but that the idea of dishonour gave him more
uneasiness than the apprehension of a violent death.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> That is, had he not preferred the honour of his country to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>own interest. Surely, when self-love by all accounts takes so very
wide a range and embraces entirely new objects of a character so
utterly opposed to its general circumscribed and paltry routine of
action, it would be as well to designate it by some new and appropriate
appellation, unless it were meant, by the intervention of the old
and ambiguous term, to confound the important practical distinction
which subsists between the puny circle of a man’s physical sensations
and private interests and the whole world of virtue and honour, and
thus to bring back the last gradually and disingenuously within the
verge of the former. Things without names are unapt to take root
in the human mind: we are prone to reduce nature to the dimensions
of language. If a feeling of a refined and romantic character is
expressed by a gross and vulgar name, our habitual associations will
be sure to degrade the first to the level of the last, instead of conforming
to a forced and technical definition. But I beg to deny,
not only that the objects in this case are the same, but that the
principle is similar.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Do you then seriously pretend that the end of sympathy is not
to get rid of the momentary uneasiness occasioned by the distress of
another?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> And has that uneasiness, I again ask, its source in self-love?
If self-love were the only principle of action, we ought to receive no
uneasiness from the pains of others, we ought to be wholly exempt
from any such weakness: or the least that can be required to give
the smallest shadow of excuse to this exclusive theory is, that the
instant the pain was communicated by our foolish, indiscreet sympathy,
we should think of nothing but getting rid of it as fast as possible, by
fair means or foul, as a mechanical instinct. If the pain of sympathy,
as soon as it arose, was decompounded from the objects which gave
it birth, and acted upon the brain or nerves solely as a detached,
desultory feeling, or abstracted sense of uneasiness, from which the
mind shrunk with its natural aversion to pain, then I would allow
that the impulse in this case, having no reference to the good of
another, and seeking only to remove a present inconvenience from the
individual, would still be properly self-love: but no such process of
abstraction takes place. The feeling of compassion, as it first enters
the mind, so it continues to act upon it in conjunction with the idea
of what another suffers; refers every wish it forms or every effort it
makes, to the removal of pain from a fellow-creature, and is only
satisfied when it believes this end to be accomplished. It is not a
blind, physical repugnance to pain, as affecting ourselves, but
rational or intelligible conception of it as existing out of ourselves,
that prompts and sustains our exertions in behalf of humanity. Nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>can it be otherwise, while man is the creature of imagination and
reason, and has faculties that implicate him (whether he will or not)
in the pleasures and pains of others, and bind up his fate with theirs.
Why, then, when an action or feeling is neither in its commencement
nor progress, nor ultimate objects, dictated by or subject to the control
of self-love, bestow the name where every thing but the name is
wanting?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> I must give you fair warning, that in this last <em>tirade</em> you have
more than once gone beyond my comprehension. Your distinctions
are too fine-drawn, and there is a want of relief in the expression.
Are you not getting back to what you describe as your <em>first manner</em>?
Your present style is more amusing. See if you cannot throw a few
high lights into that last argument!</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> <em>Un peu plus à l’Anglaise</em>—any thing to oblige! I say, then, it
appears to me strange that self-love should be asserted by any impartial
reasoner, (not the dupe of a play upon words), to be absolute and
undisputed master of the human mind, when compassion or uneasiness
on account of others enters it without leave and in spite of this
principle. What! to be instantly expelled by it without mercy, so
that it may still assert its pre-eminence? No; but to linger there, to
hold consultation with another principle, Imagination, which owes no
allegiance to self-interest, and to march out only under condition and
guarantee that the welfare of another is first provided for without any
special clause in its own favour. This is much as if you were to say
and swear, that though the bailiff and his man have taken possession
of your house, you are still the rightful owner of it.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> And so I am.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Why, then, not turn out such unwelcome intruders without
standing upon ceremony?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> You were too vague and abstracted before: now you are growing
too figurative. Always in extremes.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Give me leave for a moment, as you will not let me spin mere
metaphysical cobwebs.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> I am patient.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Suppose that by sudden transformation your body were so contrived
that it could feel the actual sensations of another body, as if
your nerves had an immediate and physical communication; that you
were assailed by a number of objects you saw and knew nothing of
before, and felt desires and appetites springing up in your bosom for
which you could not at all account—would you not say that this
addition of another body made a material alteration in your former
situation; that it called for a new set of precautions and instincts to
provide for its wants and wishes? or would you persist in it that you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>were just where you were, that no change had taken place in your
being and interests, and that your new body was in fact your old one,
for no other reason than because it was yours? To my thinking, the
case would be quite altered by the supererogation of such a new
sympathetic body, and I should be for dividing my care and time
pretty equally between them.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Captain C.</em> You mean that in that case you would have taken in
partners to the concern, as well as No. I.?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Yes; and my concern for No. II. would be something very
distinct from, and quite independent of, my original and hitherto exclusive
concern for No. I.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> How very gross and vulgar! (whispering to D——, and then
turning to me, added,)—but why suppose an impossibility? I hate
all such incongruous and far-fetched illustrations.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> And yet this very miracle takes place every day in the human
mind and heart, and you and your sophists would persuade us that it
is nothing, and would slur over its existence by a shallow misnomer.
Do I not by imaginary sympathy acquire a new interest (out of
myself) in others as much as I should on the former supposition by
physical contact or animal magnetism? and am I not compelled by
this new law of my nature (neither included in physical sensation nor
a deliberate regard to my own individual welfare) to consult the
feelings and wishes of the new social body of which I am become a
member, often to the prejudice of my own? The parallel seems to
me exact, and I think the inference from it unavoidable. I do not
postpone a benevolent or friendly purpose to my own personal convenience,
or make it bend to it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Letting <em>I should not</em> wait upon <em>I would</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the poor cat in the adage.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The will is amenable not to our immediate sensibility but to reason and
imagination, which point out and enforce a line of duty very different
from that prescribed by self-love. The operation of sympathy or
social feeling, though it has its seat certainly in the mind of the
individual, is neither for his immediate behalf nor to his remote
benefit, but is constantly a diversion from both, and therefore, I
contend, is not in any sense selfish. The movements in my breast as
much originate in, and are regulated by, the <em>idea</em> of what another
feels, as if they were governed by a chord placed there vibrating to
another’s pain. If these movements were mechanical, they would be
considered as directed to the good of another: it is odd, that because
my bosom takes part and beats in unison with them, they should
become of a less generous character. In the passions of hatred,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>resentment, sullenness, or even in low spirits, we voluntarily go through
a great deal of pain, because <em>such is our pleasure</em>; or strictly, because
certain objects have taken hold of our imagination, and we cannot, or
will not, get rid of the impression: why should good-nature and
generosity be the only feelings in which we will not allow a little
forgetfulness of ourselves? Once more. If self-love, or each
individual’s sensibility, sympathy, what you will, were like an
animalcule, sensitive, quick, shrinking instantly from whatever gave
it pain, seeking instinctively whatever gave it pleasure, and having no
other obligation or law of its existence, then I should be most ready
to acknowledge that this principle was in its nature, end, and origin,
selfish, slippery, treacherous, inert, inoperative but as an instrument of
some immediate stimulus, incapable of generous sacrifice or painful
exertion, and deserving a name and title accordingly, leading one to
bestow upon it its proper attributes. But the very reverse of all this
happens. The mind is tenacious of remote purposes, indifferent to
immediate feelings, which cannot consist with the nature of a rational
and voluntary agent. Instead of the animalcule swimming in pleasure
and gliding from pain, the principle of self-love is incessantly to the
imagination or sense of duty what the fly is to the spider—that fixes
its stings into it, involves it in its web, sucks its blood, and preys
upon its vitals! Does the spider do all this to please the fly? Just
as much as Regulus returned to Carthage and was rolled down a hill
in a barrel with iron spikes in it to please himself! The imagination
or understanding is no less the enemy of our pleasure than of our
interest. It will not let us be at ease till we have accomplished
certain objects with which we have ourselves no concern but as
melancholy truths.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> But the spider you have so quaintly conjured up is a different
animal from the fly. The imagination on which you lay so much
stress is a part of one’s-self.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> I grant it: and for that very reason, self-love, or a principle
tending exclusively to our own immediate gratification or future advantage,
neither is nor can be the sole spring of action in the human
mind.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> I cannot see that at all.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> Nay, I think he has made it out better than usual.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Imagination is another name for an interest in things out of
ourselves, which must naturally run counter to our own. Self-love,
for so fine and smooth-spoken a gentleman, leads his friends into odd
scrapes. The situation of Regulus in a barrel with iron spikes in it
was not a very easy one: but, say the advocates of refined self-love,
their points were a succession of agreeable punctures in his sides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>compared with the stings of dishonour. But what bound him to this
dreadful alternative? Not self-love. When the pursuit of honour
becomes troublesome, ‘throw honour to the dogs—I’ll none of it!’
This seems the true Epicurean solution. Philosophical self-love
seems neither a voluptuary nor an effeminate coward, but a cynic, and
even a martyr, so that I am afraid he will hardly dare show his face
at Very’s, and that, with this knowledge of his character, even the
countenance of the Count de Stutt-Tracy will not procure his admission
to the saloons.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> The Count de Stutt-Tracy, did you say? Who is he? I
never heard of him.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> He is the author of the celebrated ‘Idéologie,’ which Bonaparte
denounced to the Chamber of Peers as the cause of his disasters in
Russia. He is equally hated by the Bourbons; and what is more
extraordinary still, he is patronised by Ferdinand <span class='fss'>VII.</span> who settled a
pension of two hundred crowns a year on the translator of his works.
He speaks of Condillac as having ‘<em>created</em> the science of Ideology,’
and holds Helvetius for a true philosopher.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Which you do not! I think it a pity you should affect
singularity of opinion in such matters, when you have all the most
sensible and best-informed judges against you,</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> I am sorry for it too; but I am afraid I can hardly expect
you with me, till I have all Europe on my side, of which I see no
chance while the Englishman with his notions of solid beef and
pudding holds fast by his substantial identity, and the Frenchman
with his lighter food and air mistakes every shadowy impulse for
himself.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The New Monthly Magazine.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>December, 1828.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'><em>D.</em> You deny, I think, that personal identity, in the qualified way
in which you think proper to admit it, is any ground for the doctrine
of self-interest?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Yes, in an exclusive and absolute sense I do undoubtedly, that
is, in the sense in which it is affirmed by metaphysicians, and
ordinarily believed in.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> Could you not go over the ground briefly, without entering
into technicalities?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Not easily: but stop me when I entangle myself in difficulties.
A person fancies, or feels habitually, that he has a positive, substantial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>interest in his own welfare, (generally speaking) just as much
as he has in any actual sensation that he feels, because he is always
and necessarily the same self. What is his interest at one time is
therefore equally <em>his</em> interest at all other times. This is taken for
granted as a self-evident proposition. Say he does not feel a particular
benefit or injury at this present moment, yet it is he who is to feel it,
which comes to the same thing. Where there is this continued
identity of person, there must also be a correspondent identity of
interest. I have an abstract, unavoidable interest in whatever can befall
myself, which I can have or feel in no other person living,
because I am always under every possible circumstance the self-same
individual, and not any other individual whatsoever. In short, this
word <em>self</em> (so closely do a number of associations cling round it and
cement it together) is supposed to represent as it were a given
concrete substance, as much one thing as any thing in nature can
possibly be, and the centre or <em>substratum</em> in which the different
impressions and ramifications of my being meet and are indissolubly
knit together.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> And you propose then seriously to take ‘this one entire and
perfect chrysolite,’ this self, this ‘precious jewel of the soul,’ this
rock on which mankind have built their faith for ages, and at one
blow shatter it to pieces with the sledge-hammer, or displace it from
its hold in the imagination with the wrenching-irons of metaphysics?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> I am willing to use my best endeavours for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> You really ought: for you have the prejudices of the whole
world against you.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> I grant the prejudices are formidable; and I should despair,
did I not think the reasons even stronger. Besides, without altering
the opinions of the whole world, I might be contented with the
suffrages of one or two intelligent people.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> Nay, you will prevail by flattery, if not by argument.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> That is something newer than all the rest.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> ‘Plain truth,’ dear A——, ‘needs no flowers of speech.’</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> Let me rightly understand you. Do you mean to say that I
am not C. D. and that you are not W. B. or that we shall not both
of us remain so to the end of the chapter, without a possibility of ever
changing places with each other?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> I am afraid, if you go to that, there is very little chance that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>I</em> shall be ever mistaken for <em>you</em>.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But with all this precise individuality and inviolable identity that you
speak of, let me ask, Are you not a little changed (less so, it is true,
than most people) from what you were twenty years ago? Or do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>you expect to appear the same that you are now twenty years
hence?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> ‘No more of that if thou lovest me.’ We know what we are,
but we know not what we shall be.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> A truce then; but be assured that whenever you happen to
fling up your part, there will be no other person found to attempt it
after you.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> Pray, favour us with your paradox without farther preface.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> I will then try to match my paradox against your prejudice,
which as it is armed all in proof, to make any impression on it, I
must, I suppose, take aim at the rivets; and if I can hit them, if I
do not (round and smooth as it is) cut it into three pieces, and show
that two parts in three are substance and the third and principal part
shadow, never believe me again. Your real self ends exactly where
your pretended self-interest begins; and in calculating upon this
principle as a solid, permanent, absolute, self-evident truth, you are
mocked with a name.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> How so? I hear, but do not see.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> You must allow that this identical, indivisible, ostensible self is
at any rate distinguishable into three parts,—the past, the present, and
future?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> I see no particular harm in that.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> It is nearly all I ask. Well then, I admit that you have a
peculiar, emphatic, incommunicable and exclusive interest or fellow-feeling
in the two first of these selves; but I deny resolutely and
unequivocally that you have any such natural, absolute, unavoidable,
and mechanical interest in the last self, or in your future being, the
interest you take in it being necessarily the offspring of understanding
and imagination (aided by habit and circumstances), like that which
you take in the welfare of others, and yet this last interest is the only
one that is ever the object of rational and voluntary pursuit, or that
ever comes into competition with the interests of others.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> I am still to seek for the connecting clue.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> I am almost ashamed to ask for your attention to a statement
so very plain that it seems to border on a truism. I have an interest
of a peculiar and limited nature in my present self, inasmuch as I feel
my actual sensations not simply in a degree, but in a way and by
means of faculties which afford me not the smallest intimation of the
sensations of others. I cannot possibly feel the sensations of any one
else, nor consequently take the slightest interest in them as such. I
have no nerves communicating with another’s brain, and transmitting
to me either the glow of pleasure or the agony of pain which he may
feel at the present moment by means of his senses. So far, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>namely, so far as my present self or immediate sensations are concerned,
I am cut off from all sympathy with others. I stand alone
in the world, a perfectly insulated individual, necessarily and in the
most unqualified sense indifferent to all that passes around me, and
that does not in the first instance affect myself, for otherwise I neither
have nor can have the remotest consciousness of it as a matter of
organic sensation, any more than the mole has of light or the deaf
adder of sounds.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> Spoken like an oracle.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Again, I have a similar peculiar, mechanical, and untransferable
interest in my past self, because I remember and can dwell upon my
past sensations (even after the objects are removed) also in a way and
by means of faculties which do not give me the smallest insight into or
sympathy with the past feelings of others. I may conjecture and
fancy what those feelings have been; and so I do. But I have no
<em>memory</em> or continued consciousness of what either of good or evil may
have found a place in their bosoms, no secret spring that touched
vibrates to the hopes and wishes that are no more, unlocks the
chambers of the past with the same assurance of reality, or identifies
my feelings with theirs in the same intimate manner as with those
which I have already felt in my own person. Here again, then,
there is a real, undoubted, original and positive foundation for the
notion of self to rest upon; for in relation to my former self and past
feelings, I do possess a faculty which serves to unite me more
especially to my own being, and at the same time draws a distinct
and impassable line around that being, separating it from every other.
A door of communication stands always open between my present
consciousness and my past feelings, which is locked and barred by
the hand of Nature and the constitution of the human understanding
against the intrusion of any straggling impressions from the minds of
others. I can only see into their real history darkly and by reflection.
To sympathise with their joys or sorrows, and place myself in their
situation either now or formerly, I must proceed by guess-work, and
borrow the use of the common faculty of imagination. I am ready
to acknowledge, then, that in what regards the past as well as the
present, there is a strict metaphysical distinction between myself and
others, and that my personal identity so far, or in the close, continued,
inseparable connection between my past and present impressions, is
firmly and irrevocably established.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> You go on swimmingly. So far all is sufficiently clear.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> But now comes the rub: for beyond that point I deny that the
doctrine of personal identity or self-interest (as a consequence from
it) has any foundation to rest upon but a confusion of names and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>ideas. It has none in the nature of things or of the human mind.
For I have no faculty by which I can project myself into the future,
or hold the same sort of palpable, tangible, immediate, and exclusive
communication with my future feelings, in the same manner as I am
made to feel the present moment by means of the senses, or the past
moment by means of memory. If I have any such faculty, expressly
set apart for the purpose, name it. If I have no such faculty, I can
have no such interest. In order that I may possess a proper personal
identity so as to live, breathe, and feel along the whole line of my
existence in the same intense and intimate mode, it is absolutely
necessary to have some general medium or faculty by which my
successive impressions are blended and amalgamated together, and to
maintain and support this extraordinary interest. But so far from
there being any foundation for this merging and incorporating of my
future in my present self, there is no link of connection, no sympathy,
no reaction, no mutual consciousness between them, nor even a possibility
of any thing of the kind, in a mechanical and personal sense.
Up to the present point, the spot on which we stand, the doctrine of
personal identity holds good; hitherto the proud and exclusive pretensions
of self ‘come, but no farther.’ The rest is air, is nothing,
is a name, or but the common ground of reason and humanity. If I
wish to pass beyond this point and look into my own future lot, or
anticipate my future weal or woe before it has had an existence, I can
do so by means of the same faculties by which I enter into and
identify myself with the welfare, the being, and interests of others,
but only by these. As I have already said, I have no particular
organ or faculty of self-interest, in that case made and provided. I
have no sensation of what is to happen to myself in future, no
presentiment of it, no instinctive sympathy with it, nor consequently
any abstract and unavoidable self-interest in it. Now mark. It is
only in regard to my past and present being, that a broad and insurmountable
barrier is placed between myself and others: as to
future objects, there is no absolute and fundamental distinction whatever.
But it is only these last that are the objects of any rational or
practical interest. The idea of self properly attaches to objects of
sense or memory, but these can never be the objects of action or of
voluntary pursuit, which must, by the supposition, have an eye to
future events. But with respect to these the chain of self-interest is
dissolved and falls in pieces by the very necessity of our nature, and
our obligations to self as a blind, mechanical, unsociable principle are
lost in the general law which binds us to the pursuit of good as it
comes within our reach and knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> A most lame and impotent conclusion, I must say. Do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>mean to affirm that you have really the same interest in another’s
welfare that you have in your own?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> I do not wish to assert any thing without proof. Will you tell
me if you have this particular interest in yourself what faculty is it
that gives it you—to what conjuration and what mighty magic it is
owing—or whether it is merely the name of self that is to be considered
as a proof of all the absurdities and impossibilities that can be
drawn from it?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> I do not see that you have hitherto pointed out any.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> What! not the impossibility that you should be another being,
with whom you have not a particle of fellow-feeling?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Another being! Yes, I know it is always impossible for me to
be another being.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Ay, or yourself either, without such a fellow-feeling, for it is
that which constitutes self. If not, explain to me what you mean by
self. But it is more convenient for you to let that magical sound lie
involved in the obscurity of prejudice and language. You will please
to take notice that it is not I who commence these hairbreadth
distinctions and special-pleading. I take the old ground of common
sense and natural feeling, and maintain that though in a popular,
practical sense mankind are strongly swayed by self-interest, yet in
the same ordinary sense they are also governed by motives of good-nature,
compassion, friendship, virtue, honour, &#38;c. Now all this is
denied by your modern metaphysicians, who would reduce every thing
to abstract self-interest, and exclude every other mixed motive or
social tie in a strict, philosophical sense. They would drive me from
my ground by scholastic subtleties and newfangled phrases; am I to
blame then if I take them at their word, and try to foil them at their
own weapons? Either stick to the unpretending <em>jog-trot</em> notions on
the subject, or if you are determined to refine in analysing words and
arguments, do not be angry if I follow the example set me, or even
go a little farther to arrive at the truth. Shall we proceed on this
understanding?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> As you please.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> We have got so far then (if I mistake not, and if there is not
some flaw in the argument which I am unable to detect) that the
past and present (which alone can appeal to our selfish faculties) are
not the objects of action, and that the future (which can alone be the
object of practical pursuit) has no particular claim or hold upon self.
All action, all passion, all morality and self-interest, is prospective.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> You have not made that point quite clear. What then is
meant by a present interest, by the gratification of the present moment,
as opposed to a future one?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span><em>B.</em> Nothing, in a strict sense; or rather in common speech, you
mean a near one, the interest of the next moment, the next hour, the
next day, the next year, as it happens.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> What! would you have me believe that I snatch my hand out
of the flame of a candle from a calculation of future consequences?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> (<em>laughing.</em>) A. had better not meddle with that question.
B. is in his element there. It is his old and favourite illustration.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Do you not snatch your hand out of the fire to procure ease
from pain?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> No doubt, I do.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> And is not this case subsequent to the act, and the act itself to
the feeling of pain, which caused it?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> It may be so; but the interval is so slight that we are not
sensible of it.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Nature is nicer in her distinctions than we. Thus you could
not lift the food to your mouth, but upon the same principle. The
viands are indeed tempting, but if it were the sight or smell of these
alone that attracted you, you would remain satisfied with them. But
you use means to ends, neither of which exist till you employ or
produce them, and which would never exist if the understanding
which foresees them did not run on before the actual objects and
purvey to appetite. If you say it is habit, it is partly so; but that
habit would never have been formed, were it not for the connection
between cause and effect, which always takes place in the order of
time, or of what Hume calls <em>antecedents</em> and <em>consequents</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> I confess I think this a mighty microscopic way of looking at
the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Yet you object equally to more vague and sweeping generalities.
Let me, however, endeavour to draw the knot a little tighter, as it
has a considerable weight to bear—no less, in my opinion, than the
whole world of moral sentiments. All voluntary action must relate
to the future: but the future can only exist or influence the mind as
an object of imagination and forethought; therefore the motive to
voluntary action, to all that we seek or shun, must be in all cases
<em>ideal</em> and problematical. The thing itself which is an object of
pursuit can never co-exist with the motives which make it an object
of pursuit. No one will say that the past can be an object either of
prevention or pursuit. It may be a subject of involuntary regrets, or
may give rise to the starts and flaws of passion; but we cannot set
about seriously recalling or altering it. Neither can that which at
present exists, or is an object of sensation, be at the same time an
object of action or of volition, since if it <em>is</em>, no volition or exertion of
mine can for the instant make it to be other than it is. I can make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>it <em>cease</em> to be indeed, but this relates to the future, to the supposed
non-existence of the object, and not to its actual impression on me.
For a thing to be <em>willed</em>, it must necessarily not be. Over my past
and present impressions my will has no control: they are placed,
according to the poet, beyond the reach of fate, much more of human
means. In order that I may take an effectual and consistent interest
in any thing, that it may be an object of hope or fear, of desire or
dread, it must be a thing still to come, a thing still in doubt, depending
on circumstances and the means used to bring about or avert it.
It is my will that determines its existence or the contrary (otherwise
there would be no use in troubling oneself about it); it does
not itself lay its peremptory, inexorable mandates on my will. For
it is as yet (and must be in order to be the rational object of a
moment’s deliberation) a nonentity, a possibility merely and it is
plain that nothing can be the cause of nothing. That which is not,
cannot act, much less can it act mechanically, physically, all-powerfully.
So far is it from being true that a real and practical interest
in any thing are convertible terms, that a practical interest can never
by any possible chance be a real one, that is, excited by the presence
of a real object or by mechanical sympathy. I cannot assuredly be
induced by a present object to take means to make it exist—it can be
no more than present to me—or if it is past, it is too late to think
of recovering the occasion or preventing it now. But the future,
the future is all our own; or rather it belongs equally to others.
The world of action then, of business or pleasure, of self-love or
benevolence, is not made up of solid materials, moved by downright,
solid springs; it is essentially a void, an unreal mockery, both in
regard to ourselves and others, except as it is filled up, animated,
and set in motion by human thoughts and purposes. The ingredients
of passion, action, and properly of interest are never positive, palpable
matters-of-fact, concrete existences, but symbolical representations of
events lodged in the bosom of futurity, and teaching us, by timely
anticipation and watchful zeal, to build up the fabric of our own or
others’ future weal.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Do we not sometimes plot their woe with at least equal good-will?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Not much oftener than we are accessory to our own.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> I must say that savours more to me of an antithesis than of an
answer.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> For once, be it so.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> But surely there is a difference between a real and an imaginary
interest? A history is not a romance.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Yes; but in this sense the feelings and interests of others are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>in the end as real, as much matters of fact as mine or yours can be.
The history of the world is not a romance, though you and I have
had only a small share in it. You would turn every thing into autobiography.
The interests of others are no more chimerical, visionary,
fantastic than my own, being founded in truth, and both are brought
home to my bosom in the same way by the force of imagination and
sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> But in addition to all this sympathy that you make such a rout
about, it is <em>I</em> who am to feel a real, downright interest in my own
future good, and I shall feel no such interest in another person’s.
Does not this make a wide, nay a total difference in the case? Am I
to have no more affection for my own flesh and blood than for another’s?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> This would indeed make an entire difference in the case, if
your interest in your own good were founded in your affection for
yourself, and not your affection for yourself in your attachment to
your own good. If you were attached to your own good merely
because it was <em>yours</em>, I do not see why you should not be equally
attached to your own ill—both are equally yours! Your own person
or that of others would, I take it, be alike indifferent to you, but for
the degree of sympathy you have with the feelings of either. Take
away the sense or apprehension of pleasure and pain, and you would
care no more about yourself than you do about the hair of your head
or the paring of your nails, the parting with which gives you no
sensible uneasiness at the time or on after-reflection.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> But up to the present moment you allow that I have a
particular interest in my proper self. Where then am I to stop, or
how draw the line between my real and my imaginary identity?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> The line is drawn for you by the nature of things. Or if the
difference between reality and imagination is so small that you cannot
perceive it, it only shows the strength of the latter. Certain it is
that we can no more anticipate our future being than we change
places with another individual, except in an <em>ideal</em> and figurative sense.
But it is just as impossible that I should have an actual sensation of
and interest in my future feelings as that I should have an actual
sensation of and interest in what another feels at the present instant.
An essential and irreconcileable difference in our primary faculties
forbids it. The future, were it the next moment, were it an object
nearest and dearest to our hearts, is a dull blank, opaque, impervious
to sense as an object close to the eye of the blind, did not the ray of
reason and reflection enlighten it. We can never say to its fleeting,
painted essence, ‘Come, let me clutch thee!’ it is a thing of air, a
phantom that flies before us, and we follow it, and with respect to all
but our past and present sensations, which are no longer any thing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>action, we totter on the brink of nothing. That self which we
project before us into it, that we make our proxy or representative,
and empower to embody, and transmit back to us all our real, substantial
interests before they have had an existence, except in our
imaginations, is but a shadow of ourselves, a bundle of habits, passions,
and prejudices, a body that falls in pieces at the touch of reason or
the approach of inquiry. It is true, we do build up such an
imaginary self, and a proportionable interest in it; we clothe it
with the associations of the past and present, we disguise it in
the drapery of language, we add to it the strength of passion and
the warmth of affection, till we at length come to class our whole
existence under one head, and fancy our future history a solid,
permanent, and actual continuation of our immediate being, but all
this only proves the force of imagination and habit to build up such a
structure on a merely partial foundation, and does not alter the true
nature and distinction of things. On the same foundation are built
up nearly as high natural affection, friendship, the love of country, of
religion, &#38;c. But of this presently. What shows that the doctrine
of self-interest, however high it may rear its head, or however impregnable
it may seem to attack, is a mere ‘contradiction,’</p>

      <div class='line'>‘In terms a fallacy, in fact a fiction,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>is this single consideration, that we never know what is to happen to
us beforehand, no, not even for a moment, and that we cannot so
much as tell whether we shall be alive a year, a month, or a day
hence. We have no presentiment of what awaits us, making us feel
the future in the instant. Indeed such an insight into futurity would
be inconsistent with itself, or we must become mere passive instruments
in the hands of fate. A house may fall on my head as I go
from this, I may be crushed to pieces by a carriage running over me,
or I may receive a piece of news that is death to my hopes before
another four-and-twenty hours are passed over, and yet I feel nothing
of the blow that is thus to stagger and stun me. I laugh and am well.
I have no warning given me either of the course or the consequence
(in truth if I had, I should, if possible, avoid it). This continued
self-interest that watches over all my concerns alike, past, present, and
future, and concentrates them all in one powerful and invariable
principle of action, is useless here, leaves me at a loss at my greatest
need, is torpid, silent, dead, and I have no more consciousness of
what so nearly affects me, and no more care about it, (till I find out
my danger by other and natural means,) than if no such thing were
ever to happen, or were to happen to the Man in the Moon.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>This beautiful line is not verified in the ordinary prose of life. That
it is not, is a staggering consideration for your fine, practical, instinctive,

Don’t you think so, D——?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> I shall not answer you. Am I to give up my existence for
an idle sophism? You heap riddle upon riddle; but I am mystery-proof.
I still feel my personal identity as I do the chair I sit on,
though I am enveloped in a cloud of smoke and words. Let me
have your answer to a plain question.—Suppose I were actually to
see a coach coming along and I was in danger of being run over,
what I want to know is, should I not try to save myself sooner than
any other person?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> No, you would first try to save a sister, if she were with you.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Surely that would be a very rare instance of self, though I do
not deny it.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> I do not think so. I believe there is hardly any one who does
not prefer some one to themselves. For example, let us look into
Waverley.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Ay, that is the way that you take your ideas of philosophy,
from novels and romances, as if they were sound evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> If my conclusions are as true to nature as my premises, I shall
be satisfied. Here is the passage I was going to quote: ‘I was only
ganging to say, my lord,’ said Evan, in what he meant to be an
insinuating manner, ‘that if your excellent honour and the honourable
court would let Vich Ian Vohr go free just this once and let him gae
back to France and not trouble King George’s government again,
that any six o’ the very best of his clan will be willing to be justified
in his stead; and if you’ll just let me gae down to Glennaquoich, I’ll
fetch them up to ye myself to head or hang, and you may begin with
me the very first man.’<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c008'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> But such instances as this are the effect of habit and strong
prejudice. We can hardly argue from so barbarous a state of society.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Excuse me there. I contend that our preference of ourselves
is just as much the effect of habit, and very frequently a more unaccountable
and unreasonable one than any other.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> I should like to hear how you can possibly make that out.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> If you will not condemn me before you hear what I have to
say, I will try. You allow that D——, in the case we have been
talking of, would perhaps run a little risk for you or me; but if it
were a perfect stranger, he would get out of the way as fast as his
legs would carry him, and leave the stranger to shift for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Yes; and does not that overturn your whole theory?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span><em>B.</em> It would if my theory were as devoid of common sense as you
are pleased to suppose; that is, if because I deny an original and
absolute distinction in nature (where there is no such thing,) it
followed that I must deny that circumstances, intimacy, habit, knowledge,
or a variety of incidental causes could have any influence on
our affections and actions. My inference is just the contrary. For
would you not say that D—— cared little about the stranger for this
plain reason, that he knew nothing about him?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> No doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> And he would care rather more about you and me, because he
knows more about us?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> Why yes, it would seem so.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> And he would care still more about a sister, (according to the
same supposition) because he would be still better acquainted with
her, and had been more constantly with her?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>A.</em> I will not deny it.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> And it is on the same principle (generally speaking) that a
man cares most of all about himself, because he knows more about
himself than about any body else, that he is more in the secret of his
own most intimate thoughts and feelings, and more in the habit of
providing for his own wants and wishes, which he can anticipate with
greater liveliness and certainty than those of others, from being more
nearly ‘made and moulded of things past.’ The poetical fiction is
rendered easier and assisted by my acquaintance with myself, just as
it is by the ties of kindred or habits of friendly intercourse. There
is no farther approach made to the doctrines of self-love and personal
identity.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> E., here is B. trying to persuade me I am not myself.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>E.</em> Sometimes you are not.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> But he says that I never am.—Or is it only that I am not to
be so?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Nay, I hope ‘thou art to continue, thou naughty varlet’—</p>

<p class='c007'>You have been yourself (nobody like you) for the last forty years of
your life: you would not prematurely stuff the next twenty into the
account, till you have had them fairly out?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> Not for the world, I have too great an affection for them.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Yet I think you would have less if you did not look forward to
pass them among old books, old friends, old haunts. If you were cut
off from all these, you would be less anxious about what was left of
yourself.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> I would rather be the <em>Wandering Jew</em> than not be at all.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span><em>B.</em> Or you would not be the person I always took you for.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> Does not this willingness to be the Wandering Jew rather than
nobody, seem to indicate that there is an abstract attachment to self,
to the bare idea of existence, independently of circumstances or habit?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> It must be a very loose and straggling one. You mix up some
of your old recollections and favourite notions with your self elect,
and indulge them in your new character, or you would trouble yourself
very little about it. If you do not come in in some shape or
other, it is merely saying that you would be sorry if the Wandering
Jew were to disappear from the earth, however strictly he may have
hitherto maintained his <em>incognito</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> There is something in that; and as well as I remember there
is a curious but exceedingly mystical illustration of this point in an
original Essay of yours which I have read and spoken to you about.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> I believe there is; but A—— is tired of making objections,
and I of answering them to no purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>D.</em> I have the book in the closet, and if you like, we will turn to
the place. It is after that burst of enthusiastic recollection (the only
one in the book) that Southey said at the time was something between
the manner of Milton’s prose-works and Jeremy Taylor.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>B.</em> Ah! I as little thought then that I should ever be set down as
a florid prose-writer as that he would become poet-laureat!</p>

<p class='c007'><em>J. D.</em> here took the volume from his brother, and read the following
passage from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘I do not think I should illustrate the foregoing reasoning so well
by any thing I could add on the subject, as by relating the manner in
which it first struck me. There are moments in the life of a solitary
thinker which are to him what the evening of some great victory is to
the conqueror and hero—milder triumphs long remembered with
truer and deeper delight. And though the shouts of multitudes do
not hail his success—though gay trophies, though the sounds of
music, the glittering of armour, and the neighing of steeds do not
mingle with his joy, yet shall he not want monuments and witnesses
of his glory—the deep forest, the willowy brook, the gathering
clouds of winter, or the silent gloom of his own chamber, “faithful
remembrancers of his high endeavour, and his glad success,” that, as
time passes by him with unreturning wing, still awaken the consciousness
of a spirit patient, indefatigable in the search of truth, and the
hope of surviving in the thoughts and minds of other men. I
remember I had been reading a speech which Mirabaud (the author
of the “System of Nature”) has put into the mouth of a supposed
Atheist at the last judgment; and was afterwards led on, by some
means or other to consider the question, whether it could properly be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>said to be an act of virtue in any one to sacrifice his own final
happiness to that of any other person or number of persons, if it were
possible for the one ever to be made the price of the other?
Suppose it were my own case—that it were in my power to save
twenty other persons by voluntarily consenting to suffer for them:
Why should I not do a generous thing, and never trouble myself
about what might be the consequence to myself the Lord knows
when?</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The reason why a man should prefer his own future welfare to
that of others is, that he has a necessary, absolute interest in the one,
which he cannot have in the other—and this, again, is a consequence
of his being always the same individual, of his continued identity with
himself. The difference, I thought, was this, that however insensible
I may be to my own interest at any future period, yet when the time
comes I shall feel differently about it. I shall then judge of it from
the actual impression of the object, that is, truly and certainly; and
as I shall still be conscious of my past feelings, and shall bitterly
regret my own folly and insensibility, I ought, as a rational agent, to
be determined now by what I shall then wish I had done, when I
shall feel the consequences of my actions most deeply and sensibly.
It is this continued consciousness of my own feelings which gives me
an immediate interest in whatever relates to my future welfare, and
makes me at all times accountable to myself for my own conduct.
As, therefore, this consciousness will be renewed in me after death,
if I exist again at all—But stop—as I must be conscious of my past
feelings to be myself, and as this conscious being will be myself, how
if that consciousness should be transferred to some other being?
How am I to know that I am not imposed upon by a false claim of
identity? But that is ridiculous, because you will have no other self
than that which arises from this very consciousness. Why, then,
this self may be multiplied in as many different beings as the Deity
may think proper to endue with the same consciousness; which, if it
can be renewed at will in any one instance, may clearly be so in a
hundred others. Am I to regard all these as equally myself? Am
I equally interested in the fate of all? Or if I must fix upon some
one of them in particular as my representative and other self, how am
I to be determined in my choice? Here, then, I saw an end put to
my speculations about absolute self-interest and personal identity. I
saw plainly that the consciousness of my own feelings, which is made
the foundation of my continued interest in them, could not extend to
what had never been, and might never be; that my identity with
myself must be confined to the connection between my past and
present being; that with respect to my future feelings or interests,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>they could have no communication with, or influence over, my present
feelings and interests, merely because they were future; that I shall
be hereafter affected by the recollection of my past feelings and
actions; and my remorse be equally heightened by reflecting on my
past folly and late-earned wisdom, whether I am really the same
being, or have only the same consciousness renewed in me; but that
to suppose that this remorse can re-act in the reverse order on my
present feelings, or give me an immediate interest in my future feelings,
before they exist, is an express contradiction in terms. It can
only affect me as an imaginary idea, or an idea of truth. But so
may the interests of others; and the question proposed was, whether
I have not some real, necessary, absolute interest in whatever relates
to my future being, in consequence of my immediate connection with
myself—independently of the general impression which all positive
ideas have on my mind. How, then, can this pretended unity of
consciousness which is only reflected from the past—which makes me
so little acquainted with the future that I cannot even tell for a
moment how long it will be continued, whether it will be entirely
interrupted by or renewed in me after death, and which might be
multiplied in I don’t know how many different beings, and prolonged
by complicated sufferings, without my being any the wiser for it,—how,
I say, can a principle of this sort identify my present with my
future interests, and make me as much a participator in what does not
at all affect me as if it were actually impressed on my senses? It
is plain, as this conscious being may be decompounded, entirely
destroyed, renewed again, or multiplied in a great number of beings,
and as, whichever of these takes place, it cannot produce the least
alteration in my present being—that what I am does not depend on
what I am to be, and that there is no communication between my
future interests, and the motives by which my present conduct must
be governed. This can no more be influenced by what may be my
future feelings with respect to it, than it will then be possible for me
to alter my past conduct by wishing that I had acted differently. I
cannot, therefore, have a principle of active self-interest arising out of
the immediate connection between my present and future self, for no
such connection exists, or is possible. I am what I am in spite of
the future. My feelings, actions, and interests, must be determined
by causes already existing and acting, and are absolutely independent
of the future. Where there is not an intercommunity of feelings,
there can be no identity of interests. My personal interest in any
thing must refer either to the interest excited by the actual impression
of the object, which cannot be felt before it exists, and can last no
longer than while the impression lasts; or it may refer to the particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>manner in which I am mechanically affected by the idea of my
own impressions in the absence of the object. I can, therefore, have
no proper personal interest in my future impressions, since neither my
ideas of future objects, nor my feelings with respect to them, can be
excited either directly or indirectly by the impressions themselves, or
by any ideas or feelings accompanying them, without a complete
transposition of the order in which causes and effects follow one
another in nature. The only reason for my preferring my future
interest to that of others, must arise from my anticipating it with
greater warmth of present imagination. It is this greater liveliness
and force with which I can enter into my future feelings, that in a
manner identifies them with my present being; and this notion of
identity being once formed, the mind makes use of it to strengthen
its habitual propensity, by giving to personal motives a reality and
absolute truth which they can never have. Hence it has been
inferred that my real, substantial interest in any thing, must be
derived in some indirect manner from the impression of the object
itself, as if that could have any sort of communication with my
present feelings, or excite any interest in my mind but by means of
the imagination, which is naturally affected in a certain manner by the
prospect of future good or evil.’</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE FREE ADMISSION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The New Monthly Magazine.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>July, 1830.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>A free Admission is the <em>lotos</em> of the mind: the leaf in which your
name is inscribed as having the privileges of the <em>entrée</em> for the season
is of an oblivious quality—an antidote for half the ills of life. I
speak here not of a purchased but of a gift-ticket, an emanation of the
generosity of the Managers, a token of conscious desert. With the
first you can hardly bring yourself to go to the theatre; with the last,
you cannot keep away. If you have paid five guineas for a free admission
for the season, this <em>free admission</em> turns to a mere slavery.
You seem to have done a foolish thing, and to have committed an
extravagance under the plea of economy. You are struck with
remorse. You are impressed with a conviction that pleasure is not to
be bought. You have paid for your privilege in the lump, and you
receive the benefit in driblets. The five pounds you are out of pocket
does not meet with an adequate compensation the first night, or on
any single occasion—you must come again, and use double diligence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>to strike a balance to make up your large arrears; instead of an
obvious saving, it hangs as a dead-weight on your satisfaction all the
year; and the improvident price you have paid for them kills every
ephemeral enjoyment, and poisons the flattering illusions of the scene.
You have incurred a debt, and must go every night to redeem it; and
as you do not like being tied to the oar, or making a toil of a pleasure,
you stay away altogether; give up the promised luxury as a bad
speculation; sit sullenly at home, or bend your loitering feet in any
other direction; and putting up with the first loss, resolve never to be
guilty of the like folly again. But it is not thus with the possessor of
a Free Admission, truly so called. His is a pure pleasure, a clear
gain. He feels none of these irksome qualms and misgivings. He
marches to the theatre like a favoured lover; if he is compelled to
absent himself, he feels all the impatience and compunction of a
prisoner. The portal of the Temple of the Muses stands wide open
to him, closing the vista of the day—when he turns his back upon it
at night with steps gradual and slow, mingled with the common crowd,
but conscious of a virtue which they have not, he says, ‘I shall come
again to-morrow!’ In passing through the streets, he casts a sidelong,
careless glance at the playbills: he reads the papers chiefly with
a view to see what is the play for the following day, or the ensuing
week. If it is something new, he is glad; if it is old, he is resigned—but
he goes in either case. His steps bend mechanically that way—pleasure
becomes a habit, and habit a duty—he fulfils his destiny—he
walks deliberately along Long-acre (you may tell a man going to
the play, and whether he pays or has a free admission)—quickens his
pace as he turns the corner of Bow-street, and arrives breathless and
in haste at the welcome spot, where on presenting himself, he receives
a passport that is a release from care, thought, toil, for the evening,
and wafts him into the regions of the blest! What is it to him how
the world turns round if the play goes on; whether empires rise or
fall, so that Covent Garden stands its ground? Shall he plunge into
the void of politics, that volcano burnt-out with the cold, sterile,
sightless lava, hardening all around? or con over the registers of births,
deaths, and marriages, when he may be present at Juliet’s wedding,
and gaze on Juliet’s tomb? or shall he wonder at the throng of coaches
in Regent-street, when he can feast his eyes with the coach (the fairy-vision
of his childhood) in which Cinderella rides to the ball? Here
(by the help of that <em>Open Sessame!</em> a Free Admission), ensconced in
his favourite niche, looking from the ‘loop-holes of retreat’ in the
second circle, he views the pageant of the world played before him;
melts down years to moments; sees human life, like a gaudy shadow,
glance across the stage; and here tastes of all earth’s bliss, the sweet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>without the bitter, the honey without the sting, and plucks ambrosial
fruits and amaranthine flowers (placed by the enchantress Fancy
within his reach,) without having to pay a tax for it at the time, or
repenting of it afterwards. ‘He is all ear and eye, and drinks in
sounds or sights that might create a soul under the ribs of death.’
‘The fly,’ says Gay, ‘that sips treacle, is lost in the sweets’: so
he that has a free admission forgets every thing else. Why not? It
is the chief and enviable transfer of his being from the real to the
unreal world, and the changing half of his life into a dream. ‘Oh!
leave me to my repose,’ in my beloved corner at Covent Garden
Theatre! This (and not ‘the arm-chair at an inn,’ though that too,
at other times, and under different circumstances, is not without its
charms,) is to me ‘the throne of felicity.’ If I have business that
would detain me from this, I put it off till the morrow; if I have
friends that call in just at the moment, let them go away under pain
of bearing my maledictions with them. What is there in their conversation
to atone to me for the loss of one quarter of an hour at the
‘witching time of night?’ If it is on indifferent subjects, it is flat
and insipid; if it grows animated and interesting, it requires a painful
effort, and begets a feverish excitement. But let me once reach, and
fairly establish myself in this favourite seat, and I can bid a gay
defiance to mischance, and leave debts and duns, friends and foes,
objections and arguments, far behind me. I would, if I could, have
it surrounded with a balustrade of gold, for it has been to me a palace
of delight. There golden thoughts unbidden betide me, and golden
visions come to me. There the dance, the laugh, the song, the scenic
deception greet me; there are wafted Shakspear’s winged words, or
Otway’s plaintive lines; and there how often have I heard young
Kemble’s voice, trembling at its own beauty, and prolonging its liquid
tones, like the murmur of the billowy surge on sounding shores!
There I no longer torture a sentence or strain a paradox: the mind
is full without an effort, pleased without asking why. It inhales an
atmosphere of joy, and is steeped in all the luxury of woe. To show
how much sympathy has to do with the effect, let us suppose any one
to have a free admission to the rehearsals of a morning, what mortal
would make use of it? One might as well be at the bottom of a
well, or at the top of St. Paul’s for any pleasure we should derive
from the finest tragedy or comedy. No, a play is nothing without
an audience, it is a satisfaction too great and too general not to be
shared with others. But reverse this cold and comfortless picture—let
the eager crowd beset the theatre-doors ‘like bees in spring-time,
when the sun with Taurus rides’—let the boxes be filled with
innocence and beauty like beds of lilies on the first night of Isabella
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>or Belvidera, see the flutter, the uneasy delight of expectation, see
the big tear roll down the cheek of sensibility as the story proceeds—let
us listen to the deep thunder of the pit, or catch the gallery’s shout
at some true master-stroke of passion; and we feel that a thousand
hearts are beating in our bosoms, and hail the sparkling illusion
reflected in a thousand eyes. The stage has, therefore, been justly
styled ‘a discipline of humanity’; for there is no place where the
social principle is called forth with such strength and harmony, by a
powerful interest in a common object. A crowd is everywhere else
oppressive; but the fuller the play-house, the more intimately and
cordially do we sympathise with every individual in it. Empty
benches have as bad an effect on the spectator as on the players. This
is one reason why so many mistakes are made with respect to plays
and players, ere they come before the public. The taste is crude and
uninformed till it is ripened by the blaze of lighted lamps and the
sunshine of happy faces: the cold, critical faculty, the judgment of
Managers and Committees asks the glow of sympathy and the buzz
of approbation to prompt and guide it. We judge in a crowd with
the sense and feelings of others; and from the very strength of the
impression, fancy we should have come to the same unavoidable conclusion
had we been left entirely to ourselves. Let any one try the
experiment by reading a manuscript play, or seeing it acted—or by
hearing a candidate for the stage rehearse behind the scenes, or <em>top</em>
his part after the orchestra have performed their fatal prelude. Nor
is the air of a play-house favourable only to social feeling—it aids the
indulgence of solitary musing. The brimming cup of joy or sorrow
is full; but it runs over to other thoughts and subjects. We can
there (nowhere better) ‘retire, the world shut out, our thoughts call
home.’ We hear the revelry and the shout, but ‘the still, small
voice’ of other years and cherished recollections is not wanting. It
is pleasant to hear Miss Ford repeat <em>Love’s Catechism</em>, or Mrs.
Humby<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c008'><sup>[23]</sup></a> sing ‘I cannot marry Crout’: but the ear is not therefore
deaf to Mrs. Jordan’s laugh in Nell; Mrs. Goodall’s Rosalind still
haunts the glades of Arden, and the echo of Amiens’ song, ‘Blow,
blow, thou winter’s wind,’ lingers through a lapse of thirty years. A
pantomime (the Little Red Riding-Hood) recalls the innocence of
our childish thoughts: a dance (the Minuet de la Cour) throws us
back to the gorgeous days of Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> and tells us that the age of
chivalry is gone for ever. Who will be the Mrs. Siddons of a
distant age? What future Kean shall ‘strut and fret his hour upon
the stage,’ full of genius and free from errors? What favourite actor
or actress will be taking their farewell benefit a hundred years hence?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>What plays and what players will then amuse the town? Oh, many-coloured
scenes of human life! where are ye more truly represented
than in the mirror of the stage? or where is that eternal principle of
vicissitude which rules over ye, the painted pageant and the sudden
gloom, more strikingly exemplified than here? At the entrance to
our great theatres, in large capitals over the front of the stage, might
be written <span class='sc'>Mutability</span>! Does not the curtain that falls each night
on the pomps and vanities it was withdrawn awhile to reveal (and the
next moment all is dark) afford a fine moral lesson? Here, in small
room, is crowded the map of human life; the lengthened, varied scroll
is unfolded like rich tapestry with its quaint and flaunting devices
spread out; whatever can be saved from the giddy whirl of ever-rolling
time and of this round orb, which moves on and never stops,<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c008'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
all that can strike the sense, can touch the heart, can stir up laughter
or call tears from their secret source, is here treasured up and displayed
ostentatiously—here is Fancy’s motley wardrobe, the masks of all the
characters that were ever played—here is a glass set up clear and
large enough to show us our own features and those of all mankind—here,
in this enchanted mirror, are represented, not darkly, but in
vivid hues and bold relief, the struggle of Life and Death, the
momentary pause between the cradle and the grave, with charming
hopes and fears, terror and pity in a thousand modes, strange and
ghastly apparitions, the events of history, the fictions of poetry (warm
from the heart); all these, and more than can be numbered in my
feeble page, fill that airy space where the green curtain rises, and
haunt it with evanescent shapes and indescribable yearnings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Who can collect into one audible pulsation the thoughts and feelings
that in the course of his life all these together have occasioned; or
what heart, if it could recall them at once, and in their undiminished
power and plenitude, would not burst with the load? Let not the
style be deemed exaggerated, but tame and creeping, that attempts to
do justice to this high and pregnant theme, and let tears blot out the
unequal lines that the pen traces! Quaffing these delights, inhaling
this atmosphere, brooding over these visions, this long trail of glory,
is the possessor of a Free Admission to be blamed if ‘he takes his
ease’ at the play; and turning theatrical recluse, and forgetful of
himself and his friends, devotes himself to the study of the drama, and
to dreams of the past? By constant habit (having nothing to do,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>little else to think of), he becomes a tippler of the dews of Castaly—a
dram-drinker on Mount Parnassus. He tastes the present moment,
while a rich sea of pleasure presses to his lip and engulfs him round.
The noise, the glare, the warmth, the company, produce a sort of
listless intoxication, and clothe the pathos and the wit with a bodily
sense. There is a weight, a closeness even, in the air, that makes it
difficult to breathe out of it. The custom of going to the play night
after night becomes a relief, a craving, a necessity—one cannot do
without it. To sit alone is intolerable, to be in company is worse;
we are attracted with pleasing force to the spot where ‘all that
mighty heart is beating still.’ It is not that perhaps there is any
thing new or fine to see—if there is, we attend to it—but at any time,
it kills time and saves the trouble of thinking. O, Covent Garden!
‘thy <em>freedom</em> hath made me effeminate!’ It has hardly left me power
to write this description of it. I am become its slave, I have no other
sense or interest left. There I sit and lose the hours I live beneath
the sky, without the power to stir, without any determination to stay.
‘Teddy the Tiler’ is become familiar to me, and, as it were, a part
of my existence: ‘Robert the Devil’ has cast his spell over me. I
have seen both thirty times at least, (no offence to the Management!)
and could sit them out thirty times more. I am bed-rid in the lap of
luxury; am grown callous and inert with perpetual excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have my favourite box too, as Beau Brummell had his favourite
leg; one must decide on something, not to be always deciding.
Perhaps I may have my reasons too—perhaps into the box next to
mine a Grace enters; perhaps from thence an air divine breathes a
glance (of heaven’s own brightness), kindles contagious fire;—but let
us turn all such thoughts into the lobbies. These may be considered
as an Arabesque border round the inclosed tablet of human life.
If the Muses reign within, Venus sports heedless, but not unheeded
without. Here a bevy of fair damsels, richly clad, knit with the
Graces and the Hours in dance, lead on ‘the frozen winter and the
pleasant spring!’ Would I were allowed to attempt a list of some
of them, and Cowley’s <em>Gallery</em> would blush at mine! But this is a
licence which only poetry, and not even a Free Admission can give.
I can now understand the attachment to a player’s life, and how
impossible it is for those who are once engaged in it ever to wean
themselves from it. If the merely witnessing the bustle and the
splendour of the scene as an idle spectator creates such a fascination,
and flings such a charm over it, how much more must this be the case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>with those who have given all their time and attention to it—who
regard it as the sole means of distinction—with whom even the

</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The New Monthly Magazine.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>August, 1830.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>What a difference between this subject and my last—a ‘Free
Admission!’ Yet from the crowded theatre to the sick chamber,
from the noise, the glare, the keen delight, to the loneliness, the
darkness, the dulness, and the pain, there is but one step. A breath
of air, an overhanging cloud effects it; and though the transition is
made in an instant, it seems as if it would last for ever. A sudden
illness not only puts a stop to the career of our triumphs and agreeable
sensations, but blots out and cancels all recollection of and desire for
them. We lose the relish of enjoyment; we are effectually cured of
our romance. Our bodies are confined to our beds; nor can our
thoughts wantonly detach themselves and take the road to pleasure,
but turn back with doubt and loathing at the faint, evanescent phantom
which has usurped its place. If the folding-doors of the
imagination were thrown open or left a-jar, so that from the disordered
couch where we lay, we could still hail the vista of the past or
future, and see the gay and gorgeous visions floating at a distance,
however denied to our embrace, the contrast, though mortifying,
might have something soothing in it, the mock-splendour might be
the greater for the actual gloom: but the misery is that we cannot
conceive any thing beyond or better than the present evil; we are
shut up and spell-bound in that, the curtains of the mind are drawn
close, we cannot escape from ‘the body of this death,’ our souls are
conquered, dismayed, ‘cooped and cabined in,’ and thrown with the
lumber of our corporeal frames in one corner of a neglected and
solitary room. We hate ourselves and everything else; nor does
one ray of comfort ‘peep through the blanket of the dark’ to give us
hope. How should we entertain the image of grace and beauty,
when our bodies writhe with pain? To what purpose invoke the
echo of some rich strain of music, when we ourselves can scarcely
breathe? The very attempt is an impossibility. We give up the
vain task of linking delight to agony, of urging torpor into ecstasy,
which makes the very heart sick. We feel the present pain, and an
impatient longing to get rid of it. This were indeed ‘a consummation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>devoutly to be wished’: on this we are intent, in earnest, inexorable:
all else is impertinence and folly; and could we but obtain <em>ease</em> (that
Goddess of the infirm and suffering) at any price, we think we could
forswear all other joy and all other sorrows. <em>Hoc erat in votis.</em> All
other things but our disorder and its cure seem less than nothing and
vanity. It assumes a palpable form; it becomes a demon, a spectre,
an incubus hovering over and oppressing us: we grapple with it: it
strikes its fangs into us, spreads its arms round us, infects us with its
breath, glares upon us with its hideous aspect; we feel it take possession
of every fibre and of every faculty; and we are at length so
absorbed and fascinated by it, that we cannot divert our reflections
from it for an instant, for all other things but pain (and that which
we suffer most acutely,) appear to have lost their pith and power to
interest. They are turned to dust and stubble. This is the reason
of the fine resolutions we sometimes form in such cases, and of the
vast superiority of a sick bed to the pomps and thrones of the world.
We easily renounce wine when we have nothing but the taste of
physic in our mouths: the rich banquet tempts us not, when ‘our very
gorge rises’ within us: Love and Beauty fly from a bed twisted into
a thousand folds by restless lassitude and tormenting cares: the nerve
of pleasure is killed by the pains that shoot through the head or rack
the limbs: an indigestion seizes you with its leaden grasp and giant
force (down, Ambition!)—you shiver and tremble like a leaf in a fit
of the ague (Avarice, let go your palsied hold!). We then are in
the mood, without ghostly advice, to betake ourselves to the life of
‘hermit poor,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and should be glad to prevent the return of a fever raging in the
blood by feeding on pulse, and slaking our thirst at the limpid brook.
These sudden resolutions, however, or ‘vows made in pain as violent
and void,’ are generally of short duration; the excess and the sorrow
for it are alike selfish; and those repentances which are the most
loud and passionate are the surest to end speedily in a relapse; for
both originate in the same cause, the being engrossed by the prevailing
feeling (whatever it may be), and an utter incapacity to look
beyond it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is amazing how little effect physical suffering or local circumstances
have upon the mind, except while we are subject to their
immediate influence. While the impression lasts, they are every thing:
when it is gone, they are nothing. We toss and tumble about in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>sick bed; we lie on our right side, we then change to the left; we
stretch ourselves on our backs, we turn on our faces; we wrap
ourselves up under the clothes to exclude the cold, we throw them off
to escape the heat and suffocation; we grasp the pillow in agony,
we fling ourselves out of bed, we walk up and down the room with
hasty or feeble steps; we return into bed; we are worn out with
fatigue and pain, yet can get no repose for the one, or intermission for
the other; we summon all our patience, or give vent to passion and
petty rage: nothing avails; we seem wedded to our disease, ‘like
life and death in disproportion met;’ we make new efforts, try new
expedients, but nothing appears to shake it off, or promise relief from
our grim foe: it infixes its sharp sting into us, or overpowers us by
its sickly and stunning weight: every moment is as much as we can
bear, and yet there seems no end of our lengthening tortures; we are
ready to faint with exhaustion, or work ourselves up to frenzy: we
‘trouble deaf Heaven with our bootless prayers:’ we think our last
hour is come, or peevishly wish it were, to put an end to the scene;
we ask questions as to the origin of evil and the necessity of pain; we
‘moralise our complaints into a thousand similes’; we deny the use
of medicine <em>in toto</em>, we have a full persuasion that all doctors are
mad or knaves, that our object is to gain relief, and theirs (out of the
perversity of human nature, or to seem wiser than we) to prevent it;
we catechise the apothecary, rail at the nurse, and cannot so much as
conceive the possibility that this state of things should not last for
ever; we are even angry at those who would give us encouragement,
as if they would make dupes or children of us; we might seek a release
by poison, a halter, or the sword, but we have not strength of mind
enough—our nerves are too shaken—to attempt even this poor
revenge—when lo! a change comes, the spell falls off, and the next
moment we forget all that has happened to us. No sooner does our
disorder turn its back upon us than we laugh at it. The state we
have been in, sounds like a dream, a fable; health is the order of the
day, strength is ours <em>de jure</em> and <em>de facto</em>; and we discard all uncalled-for
evidence to the contrary with a smile of contemptuous incredulity,
just as we throw our physic-bottles out of the window! I see (as I
awake from a short, uneasy doze) a golden light shine through my
white window-curtains on the opposite wall:—is it the dawn of a new
day, or the departing light of evening? I do not well know, for the
opium ‘they have drugged my posset with’ has made strange havoc
with my brain, and I am uncertain whether time has stood still, or
advanced, or gone backward. By ‘puzzling o’er the doubt,’ my
attention is drawn a little out of myself to external objects; and I consider
whether it would not administer some relief to my monotonous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>languour, if I could call up a vivid picture of an evening sky I
witnessed a short while before, the white fleecy clouds, the azure
vault, the verdant fields and balmy air. In vain! The wings of
fancy refuse to mount from my bed-side. The air without has nothing
in common with the closeness within: the clouds disappear,
the sky is instantly overcast and black. I walk out in this scene
soon after I recover; and with those favourite and well-known
objects interposed, can no longer recall the tumbled pillow, the juleps
or the labels, or the unwholesome dungeon in which I was before
immured. What is contrary to our present sensations or settled
habits, amalgamates indifferently with our belief: the imagination
rules over imaginary themes, the senses and custom have a narrower
sway, and admit but one guest at a time. It is hardly to be wondered
at that we dread physical calamities so little beforehand: we think
no more of them the moment after they have happened. <em>Out of sight,
out of mind.</em> This will perhaps explain why all actual punishment has
so little effect; it is a state contrary to nature, alien to the will. If
it does not touch honour and conscience (and where these are not,
how can it touch them?) it goes for nothing: and where these are, it
rather sears and hardens them. The gyves, the cell, the meagre
fare, the hard labour are abhorrent to the mind of the culprit on
whom they are imposed, who carries the love of liberty or indulgence
to licentiousness; and who throws the thought of them behind him
(the moment he can evade the penalty,) with scorn and laughter,</p>

<p class='c007'>So, in travelling, we often meet with great fatigue and inconvenience
from heat or cold, or rather accidents, and resolve never to go a
journey again; but we are ready to set off on a new excursion
to-morrow. We remember the landscape, the change of scene, the
romantic expectation, and think no more of the heat, the noise, and
dust. The body forgets its grievances, till they recur; but imagination,
passion, pride, have a longer memory and quicker apprehensions.
To the first the pleasure or the pain is nothing when once over; to
the last it is only then that they begin to exist. The line in

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>is true only when applied to this latter sort.—It is curious that, on
coming out of a sick room, where one has been pent some time, and
grown weak and nervous, and looking at Nature for the first time, the
objects that present themselves have a very questionable and spectral
appearance, the people in the street resemble flies crawling about, and
seem scarce half-alive. It is we who are just risen from a torpid and
unwholesome state, and who impart our imperfect feelings of existence,
health, and motion to others. Or it may be that the violence
and exertion of the pain we have gone through make common every-day
objects seem unreal and unsubstantial. It is not till we have
established ourselves in form in the sitting-room, wheeled round the
arm-chair to the fire (for this makes part of our re-introduction to the
ordinary modes of being in all seasons,) felt our appetite return, and
taken up a book, that we can be considered as at all restored to
ourselves. And even then our first sensations are rather empirical
than positive; as after sleep we stretch out our hands to know
whether we are awake. This is the time for reading. Books are
then indeed ‘a world, both pure and good,’ into which we enter
with all our hearts, after our revival from illness and respite from the
tomb, as with the freshness and novelty of youth. They are not
merely acceptable as without too much exertion they pass the time
and relieve <em>ennui</em>; but from a certain suspension and deadening of
the passions, and abstraction from worldly pursuits, they may be said
to bring back and be friendly to the guileless and enthusiastic tone of
feeling with which we formerly read them. Sickness has weaned us
<em>pro tempore</em> from contest and cabal; and we are fain to be docile and
children again. All strong changes in our present pursuits throw us
back upon the past. This is the shortest and most complete emancipation
from our late discomfiture. We wonder that any one who
has read <em>The History of a Foundling</em> should labour under an indigestion;
nor do we comprehend how a perusal of the <em>Faery Queen</em>
should not ensure the true believer an uninterrupted succession of
halcyon days. Present objects bear a retrospective meaning, and
point to ‘a foregone conclusion.’ Returning back to life with
half-strung nerves and shattered strength, we seem as when we first
entered it with uncertain purposes and faltering aims. The machine
has received a shock, and it moves on more tremulously than before,
and not all at once in the beaten track. Startled at the approach of
death, we are willing to get as far from it as we can by making a
proxy of our former selves; and finding the precarious tenure by
which we hold existence, and its last sands running out, we gather
up and make the most of the fragments that memory has stored up for
us. Every thing is seen through a medium of reflection and contrast.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>We hear the sound of merry voices in the street; and this carries us
back to the recollections of some country-town or village-group—</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>A cricket chirps on the hearth, and we are reminded of Christmas
gambols long ago. The very cries in the street seem to be of a
former date; and the dry toast eats very much as it did—twenty years
ago. A rose smells doubly sweet, after being stifled with tinctures
and essences; and we enjoy the idea of a journey and an inn the
more for having been bed-rid. But a book is the secret and sure
charm to bring all these implied associations to a focus. I should
prefer an old one, Mr. Lamb’s favourite, the <em>Journey to Lisbon</em>; or
the <em>Decameron</em>, if I could get it; but if a new one, let it be <em>Paul
Clifford</em>. That book has the singular advantage of being written by a
gentleman, and not about his own class. The characters he commemorates
are every moment at fault between life and death, hunger
and a <em>forced loan</em> on the public; and therefore the interest they take
in themselves, and which we take in them, has no cant or affectation
in it, but is ‘lively, audible, and full of vent.’ A set of well-dressed
gentlemen picking their teeth with a graceful air after dinner,
endeavouring to keep their cravats from the slightest discomposure,
and saying the most insipid things in the most insipid manner, do not
make a <em>scene</em>. Well, then, I have got the new paraphrase on the
<cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite>, am fairly embarked on it; and at the end of the first
volume, where I am galloping across the heath with the three highwaymen,
while the moon is shining full upon them, feel my nerves so
braced, and my spirits so exhilarated, that, to say truth, I am scarce
sorry for the occasion that has thrown me upon the work and the
author—have quite forgot my <em>Sick Room</em>, and am more than half
ready to recant the doctrine that a <em>Free Admission</em> to the theatre is</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>FOOTMEN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The New Monthly Magazine.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>September, 1830.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>Footmen are no part of Christianity; but they are a very necessary
appendage to our happy Constitution in Church and State. What
would the bishop’s mitre be without these grave supporters to his
dignity? Even the plain presbyter does not dispense with his decent
serving-man to stand behind his chair and load his duly emptied plate
with beef and pudding, at which the genius of Ude turns pale. What
would become of the coronet-coach filled with elegant and languid
forms, if it were not for the triple row of powdered, laced, and
liveried footmen, clustering, fluttering, and lounging behind it? What
an idea do we not conceive of the fashionable <em>belle</em> who is making the
most of her time and tumbling over silks and satins within at Sewell
and Cross’s, or at the Bazaar in Soho-square, from the tall lacquey
in blue and silver with gold-headed cane, cocked-hat, white thread
stockings and large calves to his legs, who stands as her representative
without! The sleek shopman appears at the door, at an understood
signal the livery-servant starts from his position, the coach-door flies
open, the steps are let down, the young lady enters the carriage as
young ladies are taught to step into carriages, the footman closes
the door, mounts behind, and the glossy vehicle rolls off, bearing its
lovely burden and her gaudy attendant from the gaze of the gaping
crowd! Is there not a spell in beauty, a charm in rank and fashion,
that one would almost wish to be this fellow—to obey its nod, to
watch its looks, to breathe but by its permission, and to live but for
its use, its scorn, or pride?</p>

<p class='c007'>Footmen are in general looked upon as a sort of supernumeraries in
society—they have no place assigned them in any Scotch Encyclopædia—they
do not come under any of the heads in Mr. Mill’s Elements,
or Mr. Maculloch’s Principles of Political Economy; and they nowhere
have had impartial justice done them, except in Lady Booby’s
love for one of that order. But if not ‘the Corinthian capitals of
polished society,’ they are ‘a graceful ornament to the civil order.’
Lords and ladies could not do without them. Nothing exists in this
world but by contrast. A foil is necessary to make the plainest truths
self-evident. It is the very insignificance, the nonentity as it were
of the gentlemen of the cloth, that constitutes their importance, and
makes them an indispensable feature in the social system, by setting
off the pretensions of their superiors to the best advantage. What
would be the good of having a will of our own, if we had not others
about us who are deprived of all will of their own, and who wear a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>badge to say ‘I serve?’ How can we show that we are the lords
of the creation but by reducing others to the condition of machines,
who never move but at the beck of our caprices? Is not the plain
suit of the master wonderfully relieved by the borrowed trappings and
mock-finery of his servant? You see that man on horseback who
keeps at some distance behind another, who follows him as his shadow,
turns as he turns, and as he passes or speaks to him, lifts his hand to
his hat and observes the most profound attention—what is the difference
between these two men? The one is as well mounted, as well fed, is
younger and seemingly in better health than the other; but between these
two there are perhaps seven or eight classes of society, each of whom is
dependent on and trembles at the frown of the other—it is a nobleman
and his lacquey. Let any one take a stroll towards the West-end of
the town, South Audley or Upper Grosvenor-street; it is then he will
feel himself first entering into the <em>beau-ideal</em> of civilized life, a society
composed entirely of lords and footmen! Deliver me from the filth
and cellars of St. Giles’s, from the shops of Holborn and the Strand,
from all that appertains to middle and to low life; and commend me
to the streets with the straw at the doors and hatchments overhead
to tell us of those who are just born or who are just dead, and with
groups of footmen lounging on the steps and insulting the passengers—it
is then I feel the true dignity and imaginary pretensions of
human nature realised! There is here none of the squalidness of
poverty, none of the hardships of daily labour, none of the anxiety
and petty artifice of trade; life’s business is changed into a romance,
a summer’s dream, and nothing painful, disgusting, or vulgar intrudes.
All is on a liberal and handsome scale. The true ends and benefits
of society are here enjoyed and bountifully lavished, and all the
trouble and misery banished, and not even allowed so much as to exist
in thought. Those who would find the real Utopia, should look for
it somewhere about Park-lane or May Fair. It is there only any
feasible approach to equality is made—for it is <em>like master like man</em>.
Here, as I look down Curzon Street, or catch a glimpse of the taper
spire of South Audley Chapel, or the family-arms on the gate of Chesterfield-House,
the vista of years opens to me, and I recall the period of
the triumph of Mr. Burke’s ‘Reflections on the French Revolution,’
and the overthrow of ‘The Rights of Man!’ You do not indeed
penetrate to the interior of the mansion where sits the stately possessor,
luxurious and refined; but you draw your inference from the lazy,
pampered, motley crew poured forth from his portals. This mealy-coated,
moth-like, butterfly-generation, seem to have no earthly
business but to enjoy themselves. Their green liveries accord with
the budding leaves and spreading branches of the trees in Hyde Park—they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>seem ‘like brothers of the groves’—their red faces and
powdered heads harmonise with the blossoms of the neighbouring
almond-trees, that shoot their sprays over old-fashioned brick-walls.
They come forth like grasshoppers in June, as numerous and as noisy.
They bask in the sun and laugh in your face. Not only does the
master enjoy an uninterrupted leisure and tranquillity—those in his
employment have nothing to do. He wants drones, not drudges, about
him, to share his superfluity, and give a haughty pledge of his
exemption from care. They grow sleek and wanton, saucy and
supple. From being independent of the world, they acquire the
look of <em>gentlemen’s gentlemen</em>. There is a cast of the aristocracy,
with a slight shade of distinction. The saying, ‘Tell me your company,
and I’ll tell you your manners,’ may be applied <i><span lang="la">cum grano salis</span></i>
to the servants in great families. Mr. N—— knew an old butler
who had lived with a nobleman so long, and had learned to imitate
his walk, look, and way of speaking, so exactly that it was next to
impossible to tell them apart. See the porter in the great leather-chair
in the hall—how big, and burly, and self-important he looks;
while my Lord’s gentleman (the politician of the family) is reading
the second edition of ‘The Courier’ (once more in request) at the
side window, and the footman is romping, or taking tea with the maids
in the kitchen below. A match-girl meanwhile plies her shrill trade
at the railing; or a gipsey-woman passes with her rustic wares through
the street, avoiding the closer haunts of the city. What a pleasant
farce is that of ‘High Life Below Stairs!’ What a careless life do
the domestics of the Great lead! For, not to speak of the reflected
self-importance of their masters and mistresses, and the contempt with
which they look down on the herd of mankind, they have only to
eat and drink their fill, talk the scandal of the neighbourhood, laugh
at the follies, or assist the intrigues of their betters, till they themselves
fall in love, marry, set up a public house, (the only thing they are fit
for,) and without habits of industry, resources in themselves, or self-respect,
and drawing fruitless comparisons with the past, are, of all
people, the most miserable! Service is no inheritance; and when it
fails, there is not a more helpless, or more worthless set of devils
in the world. Mr. C—— used to say he should like to be a footman to
some elderly lady of quality, to carry her prayer-book to church,
and place her cassock right for her. There can be no doubt that
this would have been better, and quite as useful as the life he has led,
dancing attendance on Prejudice, but flirting with Paradox in such a
way as to cut himself out of the old lady’s will. For my part, if I
had to choose, I should prefer the service of a young mistress, and
might share the fate of the footman recorded in heroic verse by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Lady Wortley Montagu. Certainly it can be no hard duty, though
a sort of <em>forlorn hope</em>, to have to follow three sisters, or youthful
friends, (resembling the three Graces,) at a slow pace, and with
grave demeanour, from Cumberland Gate to Kensington Gardens—to
be there shut out, a privation enhancing the privilege, and making
the sense of distant, respectful, idolatrous admiration more intense—and
then, after a brief interval lost in idle chat, or idler reverie, to have
to follow them back again, observing, not observed, to keep within
call, to watch every gesture, to see the breeze play with the light
tresses or lift the morning robe aside, to catch the half-suppressed
laugh, and hear the low murmur of indistinct words and wishes, like
the music of the spheres. An <em>amateur footman</em> would seem a more
rational occupation than that of an amateur author, or an amateur artist.
An insurmountable barrier, if it excludes passion, does not banish sentiment,
but draws an atmosphere of superstitious, trembling apprehension
round the object of so much attention and respect; nothing makes women
seem so much like angels as always to see, never to converse with them;
and those whom we have to dangle a cane after must, to a lacquey of
any spirit, appear worthy to wield sceptres.</p>

<p class='c007'>But of all situations of this kind, the most enviable is that of a
lady’s maid in a family travelling abroad. In the obtuseness of
foreigners to the nice gradations of English refinement and manners,
the maid has not seldom a chance of being taken for the mistress—a
circumstance never to be forgot! See our Abigail mounted in the
<em>dicky</em> with my Lord, or John, snug and comfortable—setting out on
the grand tour as fast as four horses can carry her, whirled over the
‘vine-covered hills and gay regions of France,’ crossing the Alps
and Apennines in breathless terror and wonder—frightened at a
precipice, laughing at her escape—coming to the inn, going into the
kitchen to see what is to be had—not speaking a word of the language,
except what she picks up, ‘as pigeons pick up peas:‘—the bill paid,
the passport <em>visé</em>, the horses put to, and <em>au route</em> again—seeing every
thing, and understanding nothing, in a full tide of health, fresh air,
and animal spirits, and without one qualm of taste or sentiment, and
arriving at Florence, the city of palaces, with its amphitheatre of
hills and olives, without suspecting that such a person as Boccacio,
Dante, or Galileo, had ever lived there, while her young mistress is
puzzled with the varieties of the Tuscan dialect, is disappointed in the
Arno, and cannot tell what to make of the statue of David by
Michael Angelo, in the Great Square. The difference is, that the
young lady, on her return, has something to think of; but the maid
absolutely forgets every thing, and is only giddy and out of breath, as
if she had been up in a balloon.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>English servants abroad, notwithstanding the comforts they enjoy,
and although travelling as it were <em>en famille</em>, must be struck with
the ease and familiar footing on which foreigners live with their
domestics, compared with the distance and reserve with which they
are treated. The housemaid (<em>la bonne</em>) sits down in the room, or
walks abreast with you in the street; and the valet who waits behind
his master’s chair at table, gives Monsieur his advice or opinion without
being asked for it. We need not wonder at this familiarity and
freedom, when we consider that those who allowed it could (formerly
at least, when the custom began) send those who transgressed but in
the smallest degree to the Bastille or the galleys at their pleasure.
The licence was attended with perfect impunity. With us the law
leaves less to discretion; and by interposing a real independence
(and plea of right) between the servant and master, does away with
the appearance of it on the surface of manners. The insolence
and tyranny of the Aristocracy fell more on the tradespeople and
mechanics than on their domestics, who were attached to them by a
semblance of feudal ties. Thus an upstart lady of quality (an
imitator of the old school) would not deign to speak to a milliner
while fitting on her dress, but gave her orders to her waiting-women
to tell her what to do. Can we wonder at twenty <em>reigns of terror</em>
to efface such a feeling?</p>

<p class='c007'>I have alluded to the inclination in servants in great houses to ape
the manners of their superiors, and to their sometimes succeeding.
What facilitates the metamorphosis is, that the Great, in their
character of <em>courtiers</em>, are a sort of footmen in their turn. There is
the same crouching to interest and authority in either case, with the
same surrender or absence of personal dignity—the same submission
to the trammels of outward form, with the same suppression of inward
impulses—the same degrading finery, the same pretended deference
in the eye of the world, and the same lurking contempt from being
admitted behind the scenes, the same heartlessness, and the same
eye-service—in a word, they are alike puppets governed by motives
not their own, machines made of coarser or finer materials. It
is not, therefore, surprising, if the most finished courtier of the
day cannot, by a vulgar eye, be distinguished from a gentleman’s
servant. M. de Bausset, in his amusing and excellent <cite>Memoirs</cite>, makes
it an argument of the legitimacy of Napoleon’s authority, that from
denying it, it would follow that his lords of the bed-chamber were
valets, and he himself (as prefect of the palace) no better than head-cook.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>The inference is logical enough. According to the author’s
view, there was no other difference between the retainers of the court
and the kitchen than the rank of the master!</p>

<p class='c007'>I remember hearing it said that ‘all men were equal but footmen.’
But of all footmen the lowest class is <em>literary footmen</em>. These consist
of persons who, without a single grain of knowledge, taste, or feeling,
put on the livery of learning, mimic its phrases by rote, and are
retained in its service by dint of quackery and assurance alone. As
they have none of the essence, they have all the externals of men of
gravity and wisdom. They wear green spectacles, walk with a
peculiar strut, thrust themselves into the acquaintance of persons they
hear talked of, get introduced into the clubs, are seen reading books
they do not understand at the Museum and public libraries, dine
(if they can) with lords or officers of the Guards, abuse any party as
<em>low</em> to show what fine gentlemen they are, and the next week join
the same party to raise their own credit and gain a little consequence,
give themselves out as wits, critics, and philosophers (and as they have
never done any thing, no man can contradict them), and have a
great knack of turning editors, and not paying their contributors. If
you get five pounds from one of them, he never forgives it. With
the proceeds thus appropriated, the book-worm graduates a dandy,
hires expensive apartments, sports a tandem, and it is inferred that he
must be a great author who can support such an appearance with his
pen, and a great genius who can conduct so many learned works
while his time is devoted to the gay, the fair, and the rich. This introduces
him to new editorships, to new and more select friendships, and
to more frequent and importunate demands from debts and duns. At
length the bubble bursts and disappears, and you hear no more of our
classical adventurer, except from the invectives and self-reproaches
of those who took him for a great scholar from his wearing green
spectacles and Wellington-boots. Such a candidate for literary
honours bears the same relation to the man of letters, that the valet
with his second-hand finery and servile airs does to his master.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ON THE WANT OF MONEY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Monthly Magazine.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>January, 1827.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>It is hard to be without money. To get on without it is like
travelling in a foreign country without a passport—you are stopped,
suspected, and made ridiculous at every turn, besides being subjected
to the most serious inconveniences. The want of money I here
allude to is not altogether that which arises from absolute poverty—where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>there is a downright absence of the common necessaries of
life, this must be remedied by incessant hard labour, and the least we
can receive in return is a supply of our daily wants—but that uncertain,
casual, precarious mode of existence, in which the temptation to
spend remains after the means are exhausted, the want of money
joined with the hope and possibility of getting it, the intermediate
state of difficulty and suspense between the last guinea or shilling and
the next that we may have the good luck to encounter. This gap,
this unwelcome interval constantly recurring, however shabbily got
over, is really full of many anxieties, misgivings, mortifications,
meannesses, and deplorable embarrassments of every description. I
may attempt (this essay is not a fanciful speculation) to enlarge upon
a few of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hard to go without one’s dinner through sheer distress, but
harder still to go without one’s breakfast. Upon the strength of that
first and aboriginal meal, one may muster courage to face the
difficulties before one, and to dare the worst: but to be roused out
of one’s warm bed, and perhaps a profound oblivion of care, with
golden dreams (for poverty does not prevent golden dreams), and
told there is nothing for breakfast, is cold comfort for which one’s
half-strung nerves are not prepared, and throws a damp upon the
prospects of the day. It is a bad beginning. A man without a
breakfast is a poor creature, unfit to go in search of one, to meet the
frown of the world, or to borrow a shilling of a friend. He may
beg at the corner of a street—nothing is too mean for the tone of his
feelings—robbing on the highway is out of the question, as requiring
too much courage, and some opinion of a man’s self. It is, indeed,
as old Fuller, or some worthy of that age, expresses it, ‘the heaviest
stone which melancholy can throw at a man,’ to learn, the first thing
after he rises in the morning, or even to be dunned with it in bed,
that there is no loaf, tea, or butter in the house, and that the baker,
the grocer, and butterman have refused to give any farther credit.
This is taking one sadly at a disadvantage. It is striking at one’s spirit
and resolution in their very source,—the stomach—it is attacking one on
the side of hunger and mortification at once; it is casting one into the
very mire of humility and Slough of Despond. The worst is, to know
what face to put upon the matter, what excuse to make to the servants,
what answer to send to the tradespeople; whether to laugh it off, or be
grave, or angry, or indifferent; in short, to know how to parry off an
evil which you cannot help. What a luxury, what a God’s-send in
such a dilemma, to find a half-crown which had slipped through a hole
in the lining of your waistcoat, a crumpled bank-note in your breeches-pocket,
or a guinea clinking in the bottom of your trunk, which had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>been thoughtlessly left there out of a former heap! Vain hope!
Unfounded illusion! The experienced in such matters know better,
and laugh in their sleeves at so improbable a suggestion. Not a
corner, not a cranny, not a pocket, not a drawer has been left
unrummaged, or has not been subjected over and over again to more
than the strictness of a custom-house scrutiny. Not the slightest
rustle of a piece of bank-paper, not the gentlest pressure of a piece of
hard metal, but would have given notice of its hiding-place with
electrical rapidity, long before, in such circumstances. All the
variety of pecuniary resources which form a legal tender on the
current coin of the realm, are assuredly drained, exhausted to the last
farthing before this time. But is there nothing in the house that one
can turn to account! Is there not an old family-watch, or piece of
plate, or a ring, or some worthless trinket that one could part with?
nothing belonging to one’s-self or a friend, that one could raise the
wind upon, till something better turns up? At this moment an
old clothes-man passes, and his deep, harsh tones sound like an
intended insult on one’s distress, and banish the thought of applying
for his assistance, as one’s eye glanced furtively at an old hat or a
great coat, hung up behind a closet-door. Humiliating contemplations!
Miserable uncertainty! One hesitates, and the opportunity is gone
by; for without one’s breakfast, one has not the resolution to do
any thing!—The late Mr. Sheridan was often reduced to this
unpleasant predicament. Possibly he had little appetite for breakfast
himself; but the servants complained bitterly on this head, and said
that Mrs. Sheridan was sometimes kept waiting for a couple of hours,
while they had to hunt through the neighbourhood, and beat up for
coffee, eggs, and French rolls. The same perplexity in this instance
appears to have extended to the providing for the dinner; for so
sharp-set were they, that to cut short a debate with a butcher’s
apprentice about leaving a leg of mutton without the money, the
cook clapped it into the pot: the butcher’s boy, probably used to
such encounters, with equal coolness took it out again, and marched
off with it in his tray in triumph. It required a man to be the
author of <span class='sc'>The School for Scandal</span>, to run the gauntlet of such
disagreeable occurrences every hour of the day. There was one
comfort, however, that poor Sheridan had: he did not foresee that
Mr. Moore would write his Life!<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c008'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>The going without a dinner is another of the miseries of wanting
money, though one can bear up against this calamity better than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>former, which really ‘blights the tender blossom and promise of the
day.’ With one good meal, one may hold a parley with hunger and
moralize upon temperance. One has time to turn one’s-self and
look about one—to ‘screw one’s courage to the sticking-place,’ to
graduate the scale of disappointment, and stave off appetite till supper-time.
You gain time, and time in this weather-cock world is
everything. You may dine at two, or at six, or seven—as most
convenient. You may in the meanwhile receive an invitation to
dinner, or some one (not knowing how you are circumstanced) may
send you a present of a haunch of venison or a brace of pheasants from
the country, or a distant relation may die and leave you a legacy, or
a patron may call and overwhelm you with his smiles and bounty,</p>

<p class='c013'>or there is no saying what may happen. One may wait for dinner—breakfast
admits of no delay, of no interval interposed between that
and our first waking thoughts.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c008'><sup>[27]</sup></a> Besides, there are shifts and devices,
shabby and mortifying enough, but still available in case of need.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>How many expedients are there in this great city (London), time
out of mind and times without number, resorted to by the dilapidated
and thrifty speculator, to get through this grand difficulty without
utter failure! One may dive into a cellar, and dine on boiled beef
and carrots for tenpence, with the knives and forks chained to the
table, and jostled by greasy elbows that seem to make such a precaution
not unnecessary (hunger is proof against indignity!)—or one
may contrive to part with a superfluous article of wearing apparel,
and carry home a mutton-chop and cook it in a garret; or one may
drop in at a friend’s at the dinner-hour, and be asked to stay or not;
or one may walk out and take a turn in the Park, about the time, and
return home to tea, so as at least to avoid the sting of the evil—the
appearance of not having dined. You then have the laugh on your
side, having deceived the gossips, and can submit to the want of a sumptuous
repast without murmuring, having saved your pride, and made a
virtue of necessity. I say all this may be done by a man without a
family (for what business has a man without money with one?—<em>See
English Malthus and Scotch Macculloch</em>)—and it is only my intention
here to bring forward such instances of the want of money as are
tolerable both in theory and practice. I once lived on coffee (as an
experiment) for a fortnight together, while I was finishing the copy
of a half-length portrait of a Manchester manufacturer, who had died
worth a plum. I rather slurred over the coat, which was a reddish
brown, ‘of formal cut,’ to receive my five guineas, with which I
went to market myself, and dined on sausages and mashed potatoes,
and while they were getting ready, and I could hear them hissing in
the pan, read a volume of Gil Blas, containing the account of the
fair Aurora. This was in the days of my youth. Gentle reader,
do not smile! Neither Monsieur de Very, nor Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span>, over an
oyster-pâté, nor Apicius himself, ever understood the meaning of the
word <em>luxury</em>, better than I did at that moment! If the want of
money has its drawbacks and disadvantages, it is not without its
contrasts and counterbalancing effects, for which I fear nothing else
can make us amends. Amelia’s <em>hashed mutton</em> is immortal; and there
is something amusing, though carried to excess and caricature
(which is very unusual with the author) in the contrivances of old
Caleb, in ‘The Bride of Lammermuir,’ for raising the wind at
breakfast, dinner, and supper-time. I recollect a ludicrous instance of
a disappointment in a dinner which happened to a person of my
acquaintance some years ago. He was not only poor but a very poor
creature, as will be imagined. His wife had laid by fourpence (their
whole remaining stock) to pay for the baking of a shoulder of mutton
and potatoes, which they had in the house, and on her return home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>from some errand, she found he had expended it in purchasing a new
string for a guitar. On this occasion a witty friend quoted the lines
from Milton:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And ever against <em>eating</em> cares,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wrap me in soft Lydian airs!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Defoe, in his <em>Life of Colonel Jack</em>, gives a striking picture of his
young beggarly hero sitting with his companion for the first time in
his life at a three-penny ordinary, and the delight with which he
relished the hot smoking soup, and the airs with which he called
about him—‘and every time,’ he says, ‘we called for bread, or beer,
or whatever it might be, the waiter answered, “coming, gentlemen,
coming;” and this delighted me more than all the rest!’ It was
about this time, as the same pithy author expresses it, ‘the Colonel
took upon him to wear a shirt!’ Nothing can be finer than the
whole of the feeling conveyed in the commencement of this novel,
about wealth and finery from the immediate contrast of privation and
poverty. One would think it a labour, like the Tower of Babel, to
build up a beau and a fine gentleman about town. The little vagabond’s
admiration of the old man at the banking-house, who sits
surrounded by heaps of gold as if it were a dream or poetic vision,
and his own eager anxious visits, day by day, to the hoard he had
deposited in the hollow tree, are in the very foremost style of truth
and nature. See the same intense feeling expressed in Luke’s
address to his riches in the <em>City Madam</em>, and in the extraordinary
raptures of the ‘Spanish Rogue’ in contemplating and hugging his
ingots of pure gold and Spanish pieces of eight: to which Mr. Lamb
has referred in excuse for the rhapsodies of some of our elder poets on
this subject, which to our present more refined and tamer apprehensions
sound like blasphemy.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c008'><sup>[28]</sup></a> In earlier times, before the diffusion of
luxury, of knowledge, and other sources of enjoyment had become
common, and acted as a diversion to the cravings of avarice, the
passionate admiration, the idolatry, the hunger and thirst of wealth
and all its precious symbols, was a kind of madness or hallucination,
and Mammon was truly worshipped as a god!</p>

<p class='c007'>It is among the miseries of the want of money, not to be able to
pay your reckoning at an inn—or, if you have just enough to do that,
to have nothing left for the waiter;—to be stopped at a turnpike
gate, and forced to turn back;—not to venture to call a hackney-coach
in a shower of rain—(when you have only one shilling left
yourself, it is a <em>bore</em> to have it taken out of your pocket by a friend,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>who comes into your house eating peaches in a hot summer’s day,
and desiring you to pay for the coach in which he visits you);—not
to be able to purchase a lottery-ticket, by which you might make
your fortune, and get out of all your difficulties;—or to find a letter
lying for you at a country post-office, and not to have money in your
pocket to free it, and be obliged to return for it the next day. The
letter so unseasonably withheld may be supposed to contain money,
and in this case there is a foretaste, a sort of actual possession taken
through the thin folds of the paper and the wax, which in some
measure indemnifies us for the delay: the bank-note, the post-bill
seems to smile upon us, and shake hands through its prison bars;—or
it may be a love-letter, and then the tantalization is at its height:
to be deprived in this manner of the only consolation that can make
us amends for the want of money, by this very want—to fancy you
can see the name—to try to get a peep at the hand-writing—to touch
the seal, and yet not dare to break it open—is provoking indeed—the
climax of amorous and gentlemanly distress. Players are sometimes
reduced to great extremity, by the seizure of their scenes and dresses,
or (what is called) <em>the property of the theatre</em>, which hinders them
from acting; as authors are prevented from finishing a work, for
want of money to buy the books necessary to be consulted on some
material point or circumstance, in the progress of it. There is a set
of poor devils, who live upon a printed <em>prospectus</em> of a work that never
will be written, for which they solicit your name and half-a-crown.
Decayed actresses take an annual benefit at one of the theatres;
there are patriots who live upon periodical subscriptions, and critics
who go about the country lecturing on poetry. I confess I envy none
of these; but there are persons who, provided they can live, care not
how they live—who are fond of display, even when it implies
exposure; who court notoriety under every shape, and embrace the
public with demonstrations of wantonness. There are genteel beggars,
who send up a well-penned epistle requesting the loan of a shilling.
Your snug bachelors and retired old maids pretend they can distinguish
the knock of one of these at their door. I scarce know which I
dislike the most—the patronage that affects to bring premature genius
into notice, or that extends its piecemeal, formal charity towards it
in its decline. I hate your Literary Funds, and Funds for Decayed
Artists—they are corporations for the encouragement of meanness,
pretence, and insolence. Of all people, I cannot tell how it is, but
players appear to me the best able to do without money. They are
a privileged class. If not exempt from the common calls of necessity
and business, they are enabled ‘by their so potent art’ to soar above
them. As they make imaginary ills their own, real ones become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>imaginary, sit light upon them, and are thrown off with comparatively
little trouble. Their life is theatrical—its various accidents are the
shifting scenes of a play—rags and finery, tears and laughter, a
mock-dinner or a real one, a crown of jewels or of straw, are to them
nearly the same. I am sorry I cannot carry on this reasoning to
actors who are past their prime. The gilding of their profession is
then worn off, and shews the false metal beneath; vanity and hope
(the props of their existence) have had their day; their former gaiety
and carelessness serve as a foil to their present discouragements; and
want and infirmities press upon them at once. ‘We know what we
are,’ as Ophelia says, ‘but we know not what we shall be.’ A
workhouse seems the last resort of poverty and distress—a <em>parish-pauper</em>
is another name for all that is mean and to be deprecated in
human existence. But that name is but an abstraction, an average
term—‘within that lowest deep, a lower deep may open to receive us.’
I heard not long ago of a poor man, who had been for many years a
respectable tradesman in London, and who was compelled to take
shelter in one of those receptacles of age and wretchedness, and who
said he could be contented with it—he had his regular meals, a nook
in the chimney, and a coat to his back—but he was forced to lie
three in a bed, and one of the three was out of his mind and crazy,
and his great delight was, when the others fell asleep, to tweak their
noses, and flourish his night-cap over their heads, so that they were
obliged to lie awake, and hold him down between them. One should
be quite mad to bear this. To what a point of insignificance may
not human life dwindle! To what fine, agonizing threads will it not
cling! Yet this man had been a lover in his youth, in a humble way,
and still begins his letters to an old maid (his former flame), who
sometimes comforts him by listening to his complaints, and treating
him to a dish of weak tea, ‘<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Nancy!</span>’</p>

<p class='c007'>Another of the greatest miseries of a want of money, is the tap of
a dun at your door, or the previous silence when you expect it—the
uneasy sense of shame at the approach of your tormentor; the wish to
meet, and yet to shun the encounter; the disposition to bully; the
fear of irritating; the real and the sham excuses; the submission to
impertinence; the assurances of a speedy supply; the disingenuousness
you practise on him and on yourself; the degradation in the eyes of
others and your own. Oh! it is wretched to have to confront a
just and oft-repeated demand, and to be without the means to satisfy
it; to deceive the confidence that has been placed in you; to forfeit
your credit; to be placed at the power of another, to be indebted to
his lenity; to stand convicted of having played the knave or the fool;
and to have no way left to escape contempt, but by incurring pity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>The suddenly meeting a creditor on turning the corner of a street,
whom you have been trying to avoid for months, and had persuaded
you were several hundred miles off, discomposes the features and
shatters the nerves for some time. It is also a serious annoyance to
be unable to repay a loan to a friend, who is in want of it—nor is it
very pleasant to be so hard run, as to be induced to request the
repayment. It is difficult to decide the preference between debts of
honour and legal demands; both are bad enough, and almost a fair
excuse for driving any one into the hands of money-lenders—to whom
an application, if successful, is accompanied with a sense of being in
the vulture’s gripe—a reflection akin to that of those who formerly
sold themselves to the devil—or, if unsuccessful, is rendered doubly
galling by the smooth, civil leer of cool contempt with which you are
dismissed, as if they had escaped from your clutches—not you from
their’s. If any thing can be added to the mortification and distress
arising from straitened circumstances, it is when vanity comes in to
barb the dart of poverty—when you have a picture on which you had
calculated, rejected from an Exhibition, or a manuscript returned on
your hands, or a tragedy damned, at the very instant when your cash
and credit are at the lowest ebb. This forlorn and helpless feeling
has reached its <em>acme</em> in the prison-scene in Hogarth’s <span class='sc'>Rake’s
Progress</span>, where his unfortunate hero has just dropped the Manager’s
letter from his hands, with the laconic answer written in it:—‘Your
play has been read, and won’t do.’<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c008'><sup>[29]</sup></a> To feel poverty is bad; but to
feel it with the additional sense of our incapacity to shake it off, and
that we have not merit enough to retrieve our circumstances—and,
instead of being held up to admiration, are exposed to persecution and
insult—is the last stage of human infirmity. My friend, Mr. Leigh
Hunt (no one is better qualified than he to judge) thinks, that the
most pathetic story in the world is that of Smollett’s fine gentleman
and lady in gaol, who have been roughly handled by the mob for
some paltry attempt at raising the wind, and she exclaims in extenuation
of the pitiful figure he cuts, ‘Ah! he was a fine fellow once!’</p>

<p class='c007'>It is justly remarked by the poet, that poverty has no greater
inconvenience attached to it than that of making men ridiculous. It
not only has this disadvantage with respect to ourselves, but it often
shews us others in a very contemptible point of view. People are not
soured by misfortune, but by the reception they meet with in it.
When we do not want assistance, every one is ready to obtrude it on
us, as if it were advice. If we do, they shun us instantly. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>anticipate the increased demand on their sympathy or bounty, and
escape from it as from a falling house. It is a mistake, however, that
we court the society of the rich and prosperous, merely with a view
to what we can get from them. We do so, because there is something
in external rank and splendour that gratifies and imposes on the
imagination; just as we prefer the company of those who are in good
health and spirits to that of the sickly and hypochondriacal, or as we
would rather converse with a beautiful woman than with an ugly one.
I never knew but one man who would lend his money freely and
fearlessly in spite of circumstances (if you were likely to pay him, he
grew peevish, and would pick a quarrel with you). I can only
account for this from a certain sanguine buoyancy and magnificence
of spirit, not deterred by distant consequences, or damped by untoward
appearances. I have been told by those, who shared of the
same bounty, that it was not owing to generosity, but ostentation—if
so, he kept his ostentation a secret from me, for I never received
a hint or a look from which I could infer that I was not the
lender, and he the person obliged. Neither was I expected to
keep in the back-ground or play an under-part. On the contrary,
I was encouraged to do my best; my dormant faculties roused, the
ease of my circumstances was on condition of the freedom and
independence of my mind, my lucky hits were applauded, and I was
paid to shine. I am not ashamed of such patronage as this, nor do I
regret any circumstance relating to it but its termination. People
endure existence even in Paris: the rows of chairs on the Boulevards
are gay with smiles and dress: the saloons, they say, are brilliant;
at the theatre there is Mademoiselle Mars—what is all this to me?
After a certain period, we live only in the past. Give me back one
single evening at Boxhill, after a stroll in the deep-empurpled woods,
before Buonaparte was yet beaten, ‘with wine of attic taste,’ when
wit, beauty, friendship presided at the board! Oh no! Neither
the time nor friends that are fled, can be recalled!—Poverty is
the test of sincerity, the touchstone of civility. Even abroad, they
treat you scurvily if your remittances do not arrive regularly, and
though you have hitherto lived like a <em>Milord Anglais</em>. The want of
money loses us friends not worth the keeping, mistresses who are
naturally jilts or coquets; it cuts us out of society, to which dress
and equipage are the only introduction; and deprives us of a number
of luxuries and advantages of which the only good is, that they can
only belong to the possessors of a large fortune. Many people are
wretched because they have not money to buy a fine horse, or to hire
a fine house, or to keep a carriage, or to purchase a diamond necklace,
or to go to a race-ball, or to give their servants new liveries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>I cannot myself enter into all this. If I can <em>live to think, and think
to live</em>, I am satisfied. Some want to possess pictures, others to
collect libraries. All I wish is, sometimes, to see the one and read
the other. Gray was mortified because he had not a hundred pounds
to bid for a curious library; and the Duchess of —— has immortalized
herself by her liberality on that occasion, and by the handsome
compliment she addressed to the poet, that ‘if it afforded him any
satisfaction, she had been more than paid, by her pleasure in reading
the <em>Elegy in a Country Church-yard</em>.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Literally and truly, one cannot get on well in the world without
money. To be in want of money, is to pass through life with little
credit or pleasure; it is to live out of the world, or to be despised if you
come into it; it is not to be sent for to court, or asked out to dinner,
or noticed in the street; it is not to have your opinion consulted or
else rejected with contempt, to have your acquirements carped at and
doubted, your good things disparaged, and at last to lose the wit
and the spirit to say them; it is to be scrutinized by strangers, and
neglected by friends; it is to be a thrall to circumstances, an exile
in a foreign land; to forego leisure, freedom, ease of body and mind,
to be dependent on the good-will and caprice of others, or earn
a precarious and irksome livelihood by some laborious employment:
it is to be compelled to stand behind a counter, or to sit at a desk in
some public office, or to marry your landlady, or not the person you
would wish; or to go out to the East or West-Indies, or to get a
situation as judge abroad, and return home with a liver-complaint;
or to be a law-stationer, or a scrivener or scavenger, or newspaper
reporter; or to read law and sit in court without a brief, or be
deprived of the use of your fingers by transcribing Greek manuscripts,
or to be a seal engraver and pore yourself blind; or to go upon the
stage, or try some of the Fine Arts; with all your pains, anxiety,
and hopes, most probably to fail, or, if you succeed, after the
exertions of years, and undergoing constant distress of mind and
fortune, to be assailed on every side with envy, backbiting, and falsehood,
or to be a favourite with the public for awhile, and then thrown
into the back-ground—or a jail, by the fickleness of taste and some
new favourite; to be full of enthusiasm and extravagance in youth,
of chagrin and disappointment in after-life; to be jostled by the
rabble because you do not ride in your coach, or avoided by those
who know your worth and shrink from it as a claim on their respect
or their purse; to be a burden to your relations, or unable to do any
thing for them; to be ashamed to venture into crowds; to have cold
comfort at home; to lose by degrees your confidence and any talent
you might possess; to grow crabbed, morose, and querulous, dissatisfied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>with every one, but most so with yourself; and plagued out
of your life, to look about for a place to die in, and quit the world
without any one’s asking after your will. The <em>wiseacres</em> will possibly,
however, crowd round your coffin, and raise a monument at a considerable
expense, and after a lapse of time, to commemorate your
genius and your misfortunes!</p>

<p class='c007'>The only reason why I am disposed to envy the professions of the
church or army is, that men can afford to be poor in them without
being subjected to insult. A girl with a handsome fortune in a
country town may marry a poor lieutenant without degrading herself.
An officer is always a gentleman; a clergyman is something more.
Echard’s book <em>On the Contempt of the Clergy</em> is unfounded. It is
surely sufficient for any set of individuals, raised above actual want,
that their characters are not merely respectable, but sacred. Poverty,
when it is voluntary, is never despicable, but takes an heroical aspect.
What are the begging friars? Have they not put their base feet
upon the necks of princes? Money as a luxury is valuable only as a
passport to respect. It is one instrument of power. Where there are
other admitted and ostensible claims to this, it becomes superfluous,
and the neglect of it is even admired and looked up to as a mark of
superiority over it. Even a strolling beggar is a popular character,
who makes an open profession of his craft and calling, and who is
neither worth a doit nor in want of one. The Scotch are proverbially
poor and proud: we know they can remedy their poverty
when they set about it. No one is sorry for them. The French
emigrants were formerly peculiarly situated in England. The priests
were obnoxious to the common people on account of their religion;
both they and the nobles, for their politics. Their poverty and dirt
subjected them to many rebuffs; but their privations being voluntarily
incurred, and also borne with the characteristic patience and good-humour
of the nation, screened them from contempt. I little thought,
when I used to meet them walking out in the summer’s-evenings at
Somers’ Town, in their long great coats, their beards covered with
snuff, and their eyes gleaming with mingled hope and regret in the
rays of the setting sun, and regarded them with pity bordering on
respect, as the last filmy vestige of the ancient regime, as shadows of
loyalty and superstition still flitting about the earth and shortly to
disappear from it for ever, that they would one day return over the
bleeding corpse of their country, and sit like harpies, a polluted
triumph, over the tomb of human liberty! To be a lord, a papist,
and poor, is perhaps to some temperaments a consummation devoutly
to be wished. There is all the subdued splendour of external rank,
the pride of self-opinion, irritated and goaded on by petty privations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>and vulgar obloquy to a degree of morbid acuteness. Private and
public annoyances must perpetually remind him of what he is, of what
his ancestors were (a circumstance which might otherwise be forgotten);
must narrow the circle of conscious dignity more and more,
and the sense of personal worth and pretension must be exalted by
habit and contrast into a refined abstraction—‘pure in the last recesses
of the mind’—unmixed with, or unalloyed by ‘baser matter!’—It
was an hypothesis of the late Mr. Thomas Wedgwood, that there is
a principle of compensation in the human mind which equalizes all
situations, and by which the absence of any thing only gives us a
more intense and intimate perception of the reality; that insult adds
to pride, that pain looks forward to ease with delight, that hunger
already enjoys the unsavoury morsel that is to save it from perishing;
that want is surrounded with imaginary riches, like the poor poet in
Hogarth, who has a map of the mines of Peru hanging on his garret
walls; in short, that ‘we can hold a fire in our hand by thinking on
the frosty Caucasus’—but this hypothesis, though ingenious and to a
certain point true, is to be admitted only in a limited and qualified
sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two classes of people that I have observed who are not
so distinct as might be imagined—those who cannot keep their own
money in their hands, and those who cannot keep their hands from
other people’s. The first are always in want of money, though they
do not know what they do with it. They <em>muddle</em> it away, without
method or object, and without having any thing to show for it.
They have not, for instance, a fine house, but they hire two houses
at a time; they have not a hot-house in their garden, but a shrubbery
within doors; they do not gamble, but they purchase a library, and
dispose of it when they move house. A princely benefactor provides
them with lodgings, where, for a time, you are sure to find them at
home: and they furnish them in a handsome style for those who
are to come after them. With all this sieve-like economy, they can
only afford a leg of mutton and a bottle of wine, and are glad to
get a lift in a common stage; whereas with a little management and
the same disbursements, they might entertain a round of company
and drive a smart tilbury. But they set no value upon money, and
throw it away on any object or in any manner that first presents
itself, merely to have it off their hands, so that you wonder what has
become of it. The second class above spoken of not only make
away with what belongs to themselves, but you cannot keep any
thing you have from their rapacious grasp. If you refuse to lend
them what you want, they insist that you <em>must</em>: if you let them have
any thing to take charge of for a time (a print or a bust) they swear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>that you have given it them, and that they have too great a regard for
the donor ever to part with it. You express surprise at their having
run so largely in debt; but where is the singularity while others continue
to lend? And how is this to be helped, when the manner of
these sturdy beggars amounts to dragooning you out of your money,
and they will not go away without your purse, any more than if they
came with a pistol in their hand? If a person has no delicacy, he
has you in his power, for you necessarily feel some towards him;
and since he will take no denial, you must comply with his
peremptory demands, or send for a constable, which out of respect
for his character you will not do. These persons are also poor—<em>light
come, light go</em>—and the bubble bursts at last. Yet if they had
employed the same time and pains in any laudable art or study that
they have in raising a surreptitious livelihood, they would have been
respectable, if not rich. It is their facility in borrowing money that
has ruined them. No one will set heartily to work, who has the
face to enter a strange house, ask the master of it for a considerable
loan, on some plausible and pompous pretext, and walk off with it in
his pocket. You might as well suspect a highwayman of addicting
himself to hard study in the intervals of his profession.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is only one other class of persons I can think of, in connexion
with the subject of this Essay—those who are always in want
of money from the want of spirit to make use of it. Such persons
are perhaps more to be pitied than all the rest. They live in want,
in the midst of plenty—dare not touch what belongs to them, are
afraid to say that their soul is their own, have their wealth locked up
from them by fear and meanness as effectually as by bolts and bars,
scarcely allow themselves a coat to their backs or a morsel to eat, are
in dread of coming to the parish all their lives, and are not sorry
when they die, to think that they shall no longer be an expense to
themselves—according to the old epigram:</p>

<div class='c015'>—<span class='sc'>Sir Thomas Brown.</span></div>

<p class='c006'>No young man believes he shall ever die. It was a saying of my
brother’s, and a fine one. There is a feeling of Eternity in youth,
which makes us amends for every thing. To be young is to be as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>one of the Immortal Gods. One half of time indeed is flown—the
other half remains in store for us with all its countless treasures; for
there is no line drawn, and we see no limit to our hopes and wishes.
We make the coming age our own.——</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The vast, the unbounded prospect lies before us.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Death, old age, are words without a meaning, that pass by us like the
idle air which we regard not. Others may have undergone, or may
still be liable to them—we ‘bear a charmed life,’ which laughs to
scorn all such sickly fancies. As in setting out on a delightful journey,
we strain our eager gaze forward——</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Bidding the lovely scenes at distance hail,’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and see no end to the landscape, new objects presenting themselves as
we advance; so, in the commencement of life, we set no bounds to
our inclinations, nor to the unrestricted opportunities of gratifying
them. We have as yet found no obstacle, no disposition to flag; and
it seems that we can go on so for ever. We look round in a new
world, full of life, and motion, and ceaseless progress; and feel in
ourselves all the vigour and spirit to keep pace with it, and do not
foresee from any present symptoms how we shall be left behind in the
natural course of things, decline into old age, and drop into the grave.
It is the simplicity, and as it were <em>abstractedness</em> of our feelings in
youth, that (so to speak) identifies us with nature, and (our experience
being slight and our passions strong) deludes us into a belief of
being immortal like it. Our short-lived connection with existence,
we fondly flatter ourselves, is an indissoluble and lasting union—a
honey-moon that knows neither coldness, jar, nor separation. As
infants smile and sleep, we are rocked in the cradle of our wayward
fancies, and lulled into security by the roar of the universe around us—we
quaff the cup of life with eager haste without draining it,
instead of which it only overflows the more—objects press around
us, filling the mind with their magnitude and with the throng of
desires that wait upon them, so that we have no room for the
thoughts of death. From that plenitude of our being, we cannot
change all at once to dust and ashes, we cannot imagine ‘this sensible,
warm motion, to become a kneaded clod’—we are too much
dazzled by the brightness of the waking dream around us to look
into the darkness of the tomb. We no more see our end than our
beginning: the one is lost in oblivion and vacancy, as the other is
hid from us by the crowd and hurry of approaching events. Or the
grim shadow is seen lingering in the horizon, which we are doomed
never to overtake, or whose last, faint, glimmering outline touches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>upon Heaven and translates us to the skies! Nor would the hold
that life has taken of us permit us to detach our thoughts from
present objects and pursuits, even if we would. What is there more
opposed to health, than sickness; to strength and beauty, than decay
and dissolution; to the active search of knowledge than mere oblivion?
Or is there none of the usual advantage to bar the approach
of Death, and mock his idle threats; Hope supplies their place, and
draws a veil over the abrupt termination of all our cherished schemes.
While the spirit of youth remains unimpaired, ere the ‘wine of life
is drank up,’ we are like people intoxicated or in a fever, who are
hurried away by the violence of their own sensations: it is only as
present objects begin to pall upon the sense, as we have been
disappointed in our favourite pursuits, cut off from our closest ties,
that passion loosens its hold upon the breast, that we by degrees
become weaned from the world, and allow ourselves to contemplate,
‘as in a glass, darkly,’ the possibility of parting with it for good. The
example of others, the voice of experience, has no effect upon us
whatever. Casualties we must avoid: the slow and deliberate advances
of age we can play at <em>hide-and-seek</em> with. We think ourselves
too lusty and too nimble for that blear-eyed decrepid old gentleman
to catch us. Like the foolish fat scullion, in Sterne, when she hears
that Master Bobby is dead, our only reflection is—‘So am not I!’
The idea of death, instead of staggering our confidence, rather seems
to strengthen and enhance our possession and our enjoyment of life.
Others may fall around us like leaves, or be mowed down like
flowers by the scythe of Time: these are but tropes and figures
to the unreflecting ears and overweening presumption of youth. It
is not till we see the flowers of Love, Hope, and Joy, withering
around us, and our own pleasures cut up by the roots, that we bring
the moral home to ourselves, that we abate something of the wanton
extravagance of our pretensions, or that the emptiness and dreariness
of the prospect before us reconciles us to the stillness of the grave!</p>

<p class='c013'>Well might the poet begin his indignant invective against an art,
whose professed object is its destruction, with this animated apostrophe
to life. Life is indeed a strange gift, and its privileges are
most miraculous. Nor is it singular that when the splendid boon is
first granted us, our gratitude, our admiration, and our delight should
prevent us from reflecting on our own nothingness, or from thinking
it will ever be recalled. Our first and strongest impressions are taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>from the mighty scene that is opened to us, and we very innocently
transfer its durability as well as magnificence to ourselves. So newly
found, we cannot make up our minds to parting with it yet and at
least put off that consideration to an indefinite term. Like a clown
at a fair, we are full of amazement and rapture, and have no thoughts
of going home, or that it will soon be night. We know our existence
only from external objects, and we measure it by them. We
can never be satisfied with gazing; and nature will still want us to
look on and applaud. Otherwise, the sumptuous entertainment, ‘the
feast of reason and the flow of soul,’ to which they were invited,
seems little better than a mockery and a cruel insult. We do not go
from a play till the scene is ended, and the lights are ready to be
extinguished. But the fair face of things still shines on; shall we
be called away, before the curtain falls, or ere we have scarce had a
glimpse of what is going on? Like children, our step-mother Nature
holds us up to see the raree-show of the universe; and then, as if
life were a burthen to support, lets us instantly down again. Yet in
that short interval, what ‘brave sublunary things’ does not the
spectacle unfold; like a bubble, at one minute reflecting the universe,
and the next, shook to air!—To see the golden sun and the azure
sky, the outstretched ocean, to walk upon the green earth, and to be
lord of a thousand creatures, to look down giddy precipices or over
distant flowery vales, to see the world spread out under one’s finger
in a map, to bring the stars near, to view the smallest insects in a
microscope, to read history, and witness the revolutions of empires
and the succession of generations, to hear of the glory of Sidon and
Tyre, of Babylon and Susa, as of a faded pageant, and to say all
these were, and are now nothing, to think that we exist in such a
point of time, and in such a corner of space, to be at once spectators
and a part of the moving scene, to watch the return of the seasons, of
spring and autumn, to hear</p>

<p class='c013'>to traverse desert wildernesses, to listen to the midnight choir, to visit
lighted halls, or plunge into the dungeon’s gloom, or sit in crowded
theatres and see life itself mocked, to feel heat and cold, pleasure and
pain, right and wrong, truth and falsehood, to study the works of art
and refine the sense of beauty to agony, to worship fame and to dream
of immortality, to have read Shakspeare and belong to the same
species as Sir Isaac Newton;<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c008'><sup>[31]</sup></a> to be and to do all this, and then in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>moment to be nothing, to have it all snatched from one like a juggler’s
ball or a phantasmagoria; there is something revolting and incredible
to sense in the transition, and no wonder that, aided by youth and
warm blood, and the flush of enthusiasm, the mind contrives for a long
time to reject it with disdain and loathing as a monstrous and improbable
fiction, like a monkey on a house-top, that is loath, amidst its fine
discoveries and specious antics, to be tumbled headlong into the
street, and crushed to atoms, the sport and laughter of the multitude!</p>

<p class='c007'>The change, from the commencement to the close of life, appears
like a fable, after it has taken place; how should we treat it otherwise
than as a chimera before it has come to pass? There are some
things that happened so long ago, places or persons we have formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>seen, of which such dim traces remain, we hardly know whether it
was sleeping or waking they occurred; they are like dreams within
the dream of life, a mist, a film before the eye of memory, which, as
we try to recall them more distinctly, elude our notice altogether.
It is but natural that the lone interval that we thus look back upon,
should have appeared long and endless in prospect. There are others
so distinct and fresh, they seem but of yesterday—their very vividness
might be deemed a pledge of their permanence. Then, however
far back our impressions may go, we find others still older (for our
years are multiplied in youth); descriptions of scenes that we had
read, and people before our time, Priam and the Trojan war; and
even then, Nestor was old and dwelt delighted on his youth, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>spoke of the race, of heroes that were no more;—what wonder that,
seeing this long line of being pictured in our minds, and reviving as
it were in us, we should give ourselves involuntary credit for an
indeterminate period of existence? In the Cathedral at Peterborough
there is a monument to Mary, Queen of Scots, at which I used to
gaze when a boy, while the events of the period, all that had happened
since, passed in review before me. If all this mass of feeling and
imagination could be crowded into a moment’s compass, what might
not the whole of life be supposed to contain? We are heirs of the
past; we count upon the future as our natural reversion. Besides,
there are some of our early impressions so exquisitely tempered, it
appears that they must always last—nothing can add to or take away
from their sweetness and purity—the first breath of spring, the
hyacinth dipped in the dew, the mild lustre of the evening-star, the
rainbow after a storm—while we have the full enjoyment of these, we
must be young; and what can ever alter us in this respect? Truth,
friendship, love, books, are also proof against the canker of time; and
while we live, but for them, we can never grow old. We take out a
new lease of existence from the objects on which we set our affections,
and become abstracted, impassive, immortal in them. We
cannot conceive how certain sentiments should ever decay or grow
cold in our breasts; and, consequently, to maintain them in their first
youthful glow and vigour, the flame of life must continue to burn as
bright as ever, or rather, they are the fuel that feed the sacred lamp,
that kindle ‘the purple light of love,’ and spread a golden cloud
around our heads! Again, we not only flourish and survive in our
affections (in which we will not listen to the possibility of a change,
any more than we foresee the wrinkles on the brow of a mistress),
but we have a farther guarantee against the thoughts of death in our
favourite studies and pursuits, and in their continual advance. Art
we know is long; life, we feel, should be so too. We see no end of
the difficulties we have to encounter: perfection is slow of attainment,
and we must have time to accomplish it in. Rubens complained that
when he had just learnt his art, he was snatched away from it: we
trust we shall be more fortunate! A wrinkle in an old head takes
whole days to finish it properly: but to catch ‘the Raphael grace,
the Guido air,’ no limit should be put to our endeavours. What a
prospect for the future! What a task we have entered upon! and
shall we be arrested in the middle of it? We do not reckon our
time thus employed lost, or our pains thrown away, or our progress
slow—we do not droop or grow tired, but ‘gain new vigour at our
endless task;‘—and shall Time grudge us the opportunity to finish
what we have auspiciously begun, and have formed a sort of compact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>with nature to achieve? The fame of the great names we look up to
is also imperishable; and shall not we, who contemplate it with such
intense yearnings, imbibe a portion of ethereal fire, the <i><span lang="la">divinæ particula
auræ</span></i>, which nothing can extinguish? I remember to have looked at
a print of Rembrandt for hours together, without being conscious of
the flight of time, trying to resolve it into its component parts, to connect
its strong and sharp gradations, to learn the secret of its reflected
lights, and found neither satiety nor pause in the prosecution of my
studies. The print over which I was poring would last long enough;
why should the idea in my mind, which was finer, more impalpable,
perish before it? At this, I redoubled the ardour of my pursuit, and
by the very subtlety and refinement of my inquiries, seemed to bespeak
for them an exemption from corruption and the rude grasp of Death.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c008'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Objects, on our first acquaintance with them, have that singleness
and integrity of impression that it seems as if nothing could destroy
or obliterate them, so firmly are they stamped and rivetted on the
brain. We repose on them with a sort of voluptuous indolence, in
full faith and boundless confidence. We are absorbed in the present
moment, or return to the same point—idling away a great deal of
time in youth, thinking we have enough and to spare. There is often
a local feeling in the air, which is as fixed as if it were of marble;
we loiter in dim cloisters, losing ourselves in thought and in their
glimmering arches; a winding road before us seems as long as the
journey of life, and as full of events. Time and experience dissipate
this illusion; and by reducing them to detail, circumscribe the limits
of our expectations. It is only as the pageant of life passes by and
the masques turn their backs upon us, that we see through the deception,
or believe that the train will have an end. In many cases, the
slow progress and monotonous texture of our lives, before we mingle
with the world and are embroiled in its affairs, has a tendency to aid
the same feeling. We have a difficulty, when left to ourselves, and
without the resource of books or some more lively pursuit, to ‘beguile
the slow and creeping hours of time,’ and argue that if it moves on
always at this tedious snail’s-pace, it can never come to an end. We
are willing to skip over certain portions of it that separate us from
favourite objects, that irritate ourselves at the unnecessary delay.
The young are prodigal of life from a superabundance of it; the old
are tenacious on the same score, because they have little left, and
cannot enjoy even what remains of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>For my part, I set out in life with the French Revolution, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>that event had considerable influence on my early feelings, as on
those of others. Youth was then doubly such. It was the dawn of
a new era, a new impulse had been given to men’s minds, and the
sun of Liberty rose upon the sun of Life in the same day, and both
were proud to run their race together. Little did I dream, while
my first hopes and wishes went hand in hand with those of the human
race, that long before my eyes should close, that dawn would be
overcast, and set once more in the night of despotism—‘total eclipse!’
Happy that I did not. I felt for years, and during the best part of
my existence, <em>heart-whole</em> in that cause, and triumphed in the triumphs
over the enemies of man! At that time, while the fairest aspirations
of the human mind seemed about to be realized, ere the image of man
was defaced and his breast mangled in scorn, philosophy took a higher,
poetry could afford a deeper range. At that time, to read the
‘<span class='sc'>Robbers</span>,’ was indeed delicious, and to hear</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘From the dungeon of the tower time-rent,</div>
      <div class='line'>That fearful voice, a famish’d father’s cry,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>could be borne only amidst the fulness of hope, the crash of the fall
of the strong holds of power, and the exulting sounds of the march of
human freedom. What feelings the death-scene in Don Carlos sent
into the soul! In that headlong career of lofty enthusiasm, and the
joyous opening of the prospects of the world and our own, the thought
of death crossing it, smote doubly cold upon the mind; there was a
stifling sense of oppression and confinement, an impatience of our
present knowledge, a desire to grasp the whole of our existence in
one strong embrace, to sound the mystery of life and death, and in
order to put an end to the agony of doubt and dread, to burst through
our prison-house, and confront the King of Terrors in his grisly
palace!... As I was writing out this passage, my miniature-picture
when a child lay on the mantle-piece, and I took it out of the case to
look at it. I could perceive few traces of myself in it; but there
was the same placid brow, the dimpled mouth, the same timid,
inquisitive glance as ever. But its careless smile did not seem to
reproach me with having become a recreant to the sentiments that
were then sown in my mind, or with having written a sentence that
could call up a blush in this image of ingenuous youth!</p>

<p class='c007'>‘That time is past with all its giddy raptures.’ Since the future
was barred to my progress, I have turned for consolation to the past,
gathering up the fragments of my early recollections, and putting
them into a form that might live. It is thus, that when we find our
personal and substantial identity vanishing from us, we strive to gain
a reflected and substituted one in our thoughts: we do not like to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>perish wholly, and wish to bequeath our names at least to posterity.
As long as we can keep alive our cherished thoughts and nearest
interests in the minds of others, we do not appear to have retired
altogether from the stage, we still occupy a place in the estimation of
mankind, exercise a powerful influence over them, and it is only our
bodies that are trampled into dust or dispersed to air. Our darling
speculations still find favour and encouragement, and we make as
good a figure in the eyes of our descendants, nay, perhaps, a better
than we did in our lifetime. This is one point gained; the demands
of our self-love are so far satisfied. Besides, if by the proofs of
intellectual superiority we survive ourselves in this world, by exemplary
virtue or unblemished faith, we are taught to ensure an interest
in another and a higher state of being, and to anticipate at the same
time the applauses of men and angels.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>As we advance in life, we acquire a keener sense of the value of time.
Nothing else, indeed, seems of any consequence; and we become
misers in this respect. We try to arrest its few last tottering steps,
and to make it linger on the brink of the grave. We can never leave
off wondering how that which has ever been should cease to be, and
would still live on, that we may wonder at our own shadow, and
when ‘all the life of life is flown,’ dwell on the retrospect of the past.
This is accompanied by a mechanical tenaciousness of whatever we
possess, by a distrust and a sense of fallacious hollowness in all we
see. Instead of the full, pulpy feeling of youth, every thing is flat
and insipid. The world is a painted witch, that puts us off with
false shews and tempting appearances. The ease, the jocund gaiety,
the unsuspecting security of youth are fled: nor can we, without
flying in the face of common sense,</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>If we can slip out of the world without notice or mischance, can
tamper with bodily infirmity, and frame our minds to the becoming
composure of <em>still-life</em>, before we sink into total insensibility, it is as
much as we ought to expect. We do not in the regular course of
nature die all at once: we have mouldered away gradually long
before; faculty after faculty, attachment after attachment, we are
torn from ourselves piecemeal while living; year after year takes
something from us; and death only consigns the last remnant of what
we were to the grave. The revulsion is not so great, and a quiet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span><em>euthanasia</em> is a winding-up of the plot, that is not out of reason or
nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>That we should thus in a manner outlive ourselves, and dwindle
imperceptibly into nothing, is not surprising, when even in our prime
the strongest impressions leave so little traces of themselves behind,
and the last object is driven out by the succeeding one. How little
effect is produced on us at any time by the books we have read, the
scenes we have witnessed, the sufferings we have gone through!
Think only of the variety of feelings we experience in reading an
interesting romance, or being present at a fine play—what beauty,
what sublimity, what soothing, what heart-rending emotions! You
would suppose these would last for ever, or at least subdue the mind
to a correspondent tone and harmony—while we turn over the page,
while the scene is passing before us, it seems as if nothing could ever
after shake our resolution, that ‘treason domestic, foreign levy, nothing
could touch us farther!’ The first splash of mud we get, on entering
the street, the first pettifogging shop-keeper that cheats us out of twopence,
and the whole vanishes clean out of our remembrance, and we
become the idle prey of the most petty and annoying circumstances.
The mind soars by an effort to the grand and lofty: it is at home,
in the grovelling, the disagreeable, and the little. This happens in
the height and hey-day of our existence, when novelty gives a stronger
impulse to the blood and takes a faster hold of the brain, (I have
known the impression on coming out of a gallery of pictures then last
half a day)—as we grow old, we become more feeble and querulous,
every object ‘reverbs its own hollowness,’ and both worlds are not
enough to satisfy the peevish importunity and extravagant presumption
of our desires! There are a few superior, happy beings, who
are born with a temper exempt from every trifling annoyance. This
spirit sits serene and smiling as in its native skies, and a divine
harmony (whether heard or not) plays around them. This is to be
at peace. Without this, it is in vain to fly into deserts, or to build a
hermitage on the top of rocks, if regret and ill-humour follow us there:
and with this, it is needless to make the experiment. The only true
retirement is that of the heart; the only true leisure is the repose of
the passions. To such persons it makes little difference whether
they are young or old; and they die as they have lived, with graceful
resignation.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ON READING NEW BOOKS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Monthly Magazine.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>July, 1827.</em></span></p>

<p class='c014'>‘And what of this new book, that the whole world make such a rout about?’—<span class='sc'>Sterne.</span></p>

<p class='c006'>I cannot understand the rage manifested by the greater part of the
world for reading New Books. If the public had read all those that
have gone before, I can conceive how they should not wish to read
the same work twice over; but when I consider the countless volumes
that lie unopened, unregarded, unread, and unthought-of, I cannot
enter into the pathetic complaints that I hear made, that Sir Walter
writes no more—that the press is idle—that Lord Byron is dead.
If I have not read a book before, it is, to all intents and purposes,
new to me, whether it was printed yesterday or three hundred years
ago. If it be urged that it has no modern, passing incidents, and is
out of date and old-fashioned, then it is so much the newer; it is
farther removed from other works that I have lately read, from the
familiar routine of ordinary life, and makes so much more addition to
my knowledge. But many people would as soon think of putting on
old armour, as of taking up a book not published within the last
month, or year at the utmost. There is a fashion in reading as well
as in dress, which lasts only for the season. One would imagine
that books were, like women, the worse for being old;<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c008'><sup>[33]</sup></a> that they
have a pleasure in being read for the first time; that they open their
leaves more cordially; that the spirit of enjoyment wears out with the
spirit of novelty; and that, after a certain age, it is high time to put
them on the shelf. This conceit seems to be followed up in practice.
What is it to me that another—that hundreds or thousands have in
all ages read a work? Is it on this account the less likely to give me
pleasure, because it has delighted so many others? Or can I taste
this pleasure by proxy? Or am I in any degree the wiser for their
knowledge? Yet this might appear to be the inference. <em>Their</em>
having read the work may be said to act upon us by sympathy, and
the knowledge which so many other persons have of its contents
deadens our curiosity and interest altogether. We set aside the
subject as one on which others have made up their minds for us
(as if we really could have ideas in their heads), and are quite on the
alert for the next new work, teeming hot from the press, which we
shall be the first to read, criticise, and pass an opinion on. Oh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>delightful! To cut open the leaves, to inhale the fragrance of the
scarcely dry paper, to examine the type, to see who is the printer
(which is some clue to the value that is set upon the work), to launch
out into regions of thought and invention never trod till now, and to
explore characters that never met a human eye before—this is a
luxury worth sacrificing a dinner-party, or a few hours of a spare
morning to. Who, indeed, when the work is critical and full of
expectation, would venture to dine out, or to face a coterie of bluestockings
in the evening, without having gone through this ordeal, or
at least without hastily turning over a few of the first pages, while
dressing, to be able to say that the beginning does not promise much,
or to tell the name of the heroine?</p>

<p class='c007'>A new work is something in our power: we mount the bench, and
sit in judgment on it: we can damn or recommend it to others at
pleasure, can decry or extol it to the skies, and can give an answer to
those who have not yet read it and expect an account of it; and thus
shew our shrewdness and the independence of our taste before the
world have had time to form an opinion. If we cannot write ourselves,
we become, by busying ourselves about it, a kind of <em>accessaries
after the fact</em>. Though not the parent of the bantling that ‘has just
come into this breathing world, scarce half made up,’ without the aid
of criticism and puffing, yet we are the gossips and foster-nurses on
the occasion, with all the mysterious significance and self-importance
of the tribe. If we wait, we must take our report from others; if
we make haste, we may dictate our’s to them. It is not a race,
then, for priority of information, but for precedence in tattling and
dogmatising. The work last out is the first that people talk and
inquire about. It is the subject on the <em>tapis</em>—the cause that is
pending. It is the last candidate for success (other claims have been
disposed of), and appeals for this success to us, and us alone. Our
predecessors can have nothing to say to this question, however they
may have anticipated us on others; future ages, in all probability,
will not trouble their heads about it; we are the panel. How hard,
then, not to avail ourselves of our immediate privilege to give sentence
of life or death—to seem in ignorance of what every one else is full
of—to be behind-hand with the polite, the knowing, and fashionable
part of mankind—to be at a loss and dumb-founded, when all around
us are in their glory, and figuring away, on no other ground than that
of having read a work that we have not! Books that are to be
written hereafter cannot be criticised by us; those that were written
formerly have been criticised long ago: but a new book is the
property, the prey of ephemeral criticism, which it darts triumphantly
upon; there is a raw thin air of ignorance and uncertainty about it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>not filled up by any recorded opinion; and curiosity, impertinence,
and vanity rush eagerly into the vacuum. A new book is the fair
field for petulance and coxcombry to gather laurels in—the butt set up
for roving opinion to aim at. Can we wonder, then, that the circulating
libraries are besieged by literary dowagers and their granddaughters,
when a new novel is announced? That Mail-Coach copies
of the Edinburgh Review are or were coveted? That the Manuscript
of the Waverley romances is sent abroad in time for the French,
German, or even Italian translation to appear on the same day as the
original work, so that the longing Continental public may not be kept
waiting an instant longer than their fellow-readers in the English
metropolis, which would be as tantalising and insupportable as a little
girl being kept without her new frock, when her sister’s is just come
home and is the talk and admiration of every one in the house? To
be sure, there is something in the taste of the times; a modern work
is expressly adapted to modern readers. It appeals to our direct
experience, and to well-known subjects; it is part and parcel of the
world around us, and is drawn from the same sources as our daily
thoughts. There is, therefore, so far, a natural or habitual sympathy
between us and the literature of the day, though this is a different
consideration from the mere circumstance of novelty. An author
now alive has a right to calculate upon the living public: he cannot
count upon the dead, nor look forward with much confidence to those
that are unborn. Neither, however, is it true that we are eager to
read all new books alike: we turn from them with a certain feeling of
distaste and distrust, unless they are recommended to us by some
peculiar feature or obvious distinction. Only young ladies from the
boarding-school, or milliners’ girls, read all the new novels that come
out. It must be spoken of or against; the writer’s name must be
well known or a great secret; it must be a topic of discourse and a
mark for criticism—that is, it must be likely to bring us into notice
in some way—or we take no notice of it. There is a mutual and
tacit understanding on this head. We can no more read all the new
books that appear, than we can read all the old ones that have disappeared
from time to time. A question may be started here, and
pursued as far as needful, whether, if an old and worm-eaten Manuscript
were discovered at the present moment, it would be sought after
with the same avidity as a new and hot-pressed poem, or other popular
work? Not generally, certainly, though by a few with perhaps
greater zeal. For it would not affect present interests, or amuse
present fancies, or touch on present manners, or fall in with the public
<em>egotism</em> in any way: it would be the work either of some obscure
author—in which case it would want the principle of excitement; or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>of some illustrious name, whose style and manner would be already
familiar to those most versed in the subject, and his fame established—so
that, as a matter of comment and controversy, it would only go
to account on the old score: there would be no room for learned
feuds and heart-burnings. Was there not a Manuscript of Cicero’s
talked of as having been discovered about a year ago? But we have
heard no more of it. There have been several other cases, more or
less in point, in our time or near it. A Noble Lord (which may
serve to shew at least the interest taken in books <em>not for being new</em>)
some time ago gave 2000<em>l.</em> for a copy of the first edition of the
Decameron: but did he read it? It has been a fashion also of late
for noble and wealthy persons to go to a considerable expense in
ordering reprints of the old Chronicles and black-letter works. Does
not this rather prove that the books did not circulate very rapidly or
extensively, or such extraordinary patronage and liberality would not
have been necessary? Mr. Thomas Taylor, at the instance, I
believe, of the old Duke of Norfolk, printed fifty copies in quarto of
a translation of the works of Plato and Aristotle. He did not choose
that a larger impression should be struck off, lest these authors should
get into the hands of the vulgar. There was no danger of a run in
that way. I tried to read some of the Dialogues in the translation of
Plato, but, I confess, could make nothing of it: ‘the logic was so
different from ours!’<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c008'><sup>[34]</sup></a> A startling experiment was made on this
sort of retrospective curiosity, in the case of Ireland’s celebrated
Shakspeare forgery. The public there certainly manifested no backwardness
nor lukewarmness: the enthusiasm was equal to the folly.
But then the spirit exhibited on this occasion was partly critical and
polemical, and it is a problem whether an actual and undoubted play
of Shakspeare’s would have excited the same ferment; and, on the
other hand, Shakspeare is an essential modern. People read and go
to see his real plays, as well as his pretended ones. The <em>fuss</em> made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>about Ossian is another test to refer to. It was its being the supposed
revival of an old work (known only by scattered fragments or lingering
tradition) which gave it its chief interest, though there was also a
good deal of mystery and quackery concerned along with the din and
stir of national jealousy and pretension. Who reads Ossian now?
It is one of the reproaches brought against Buonaparte that he was
fond of it when young. I cannot for myself see the objection.
There is no doubt an antiquarian spirit always at work, and opposed
to the spirit of novelty-hunting; but, though opposed, it is scarcely
a match for it in a general and popular point of view. It is not long
ago that I happened to be suggesting a new translation of Don
Quixote to an enterprising bookseller; and his answer was,—‘We
want new Don Quixotes.’ I believe I deprived the same active-minded
person of a night’s rest, by telling him there was the beginning
of another novel by Goldsmith in existence. This, if it could be
procured, would satisfy both tastes for the new and the old at once.
I fear it is but a fragment, and that we must wait till a new Goldsmith
appears. We may observe of late a strong craving after
<cite>Memoirs</cite> and <em>Lives of the Dead</em>. But these, it may be remarked,
savour so much of the real and familiar, that the persons described
differ from us only in being dead, which is a reflection to our
advantage: or, if remote and romantic in their interest and adventures,
they require to be bolstered up in some measure by the embellishments
of modern style and criticism. The accounts of Petrarch and Laura,
of Abelard and Eloise, have a lusciousness and warmth in the subject
which contrast quaintly and pointedly with the coldness of the grave;
and, after all, we prefer Pope’s Eloise and Abelard with the modern
dress and flourishes, to the sublime and affecting simplicity of the
original Letters.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some very just and agreeable reflections on the story of Abelard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>and Eloise, in a late number of a contemporary publication, there is
a quotation of some lines from Lucan, which Eloise is said to have
repeated in broken accents as she was advancing to the altar to receive
the veil:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">‘O maxime conjux!</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">O thalamis indigne meis! Hoc juris habebat</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">In tantum fortuna caput? Cur impia nupsi,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Si miserum factura fui? Nunc accipe pœnas,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Sed quas sponte luam.’          <em>Pharsalia</em>, lib. 8.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This speech, quoted by another person, on such an occasion, might
seem cold and pedantic; but from the mouth of the passionate and
unaffected Eloise it cannot bear that interpretation. What sounding
lines! What a pomp, and yet what a familiar boldness in their
application—‘proud as when blue Iris bends!’ The reading this
account brought forcibly to mind what has struck me often before—the
unreasonableness of the complaint we constantly hear of the
ignorance and barbarism of former ages, and the folly of restricting all
refinement and literary elegance to our own. We are indeed, indebted
to the ages that have gone before us, and could not well do without
them. But in all ages there will be found still others that have gone
before with nearly equal lustre and advantage, though by distance and
the intervention of multiplied excellence, this lustre may be dimmed
or forgotten. Had it then no existence? We might, with the same
reason, suppose that the horizon is the last boundary and verge of the
round earth. Still, as we advance, it recedes from us; and so time
from its store-house pours out an endless succession of the productions
of art and genius; and the farther we explore the obscurity, other
trophies and other landmarks rise up. It is only our ignorance that
fixes a limit—as the mist gathered round the mountain’s brow makes
us fancy we are treading the edge of the universe! Here was
Heloise living at a period when monkish indolence and superstition
were at their height—in one of those that are emphatically called the
<em>dark ages</em>; and yet, as she is led to the altar to make her last fatal
vow, expressing her feelings in language quite natural to her, but
from which the most accomplished and heroic of our modern females
would shrink back with pretty and affected wonder and affright. The
glowing and impetuous lines which she murmured, as she passed on,
with spontaneous and rising enthusiasm, were engraven on her heart,
familiar to her as her daily thoughts; her mind must have been full
of them to overflowing, and at the same time enriched with other
stores and sources of knowledge equally elegant and impressive; and
we persist, notwithstanding this and a thousand similar circumstances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>in indulging our surprise how people could exist, and see, and feel, in
those days, without having access to our opportunities and acquirements,
and how Shakspeare wrote long after, <em>in a barbarous age</em>! The
mystery in this case is of our own making. We are struck with
astonishment at finding a fine moral sentiment or a noble image
nervously expressed in an author of the age of Queen Elizabeth; not
considering that, independently of nature and feeling, which are the
same in all periods, the writers of that day, who were generally men
of education and learning, had such models before them as the one
that has been just referred to—were thoroughly acquainted with those
masters of classic thought and language, compared with whom, in all
that relates to the artificial graces of composition, the most studied of
the moderns are little better than Goths and Vandals. It is true, we
have lost sight of, and neglected the former, because the latter have,
in a great degree, superseded them, as the elevations nearest to us
intercept those farthest off; but our not availing ourselves of this
vantage-ground is no reason why our forefathers should not (who had
not our superfluity of choice), and most assuredly they did study and
cherish the precious fragments of antiquity, collected together in their
time, ‘like sunken wreck and sumless treasuries;’ and while they did
this, we need be at no loss to account for any examples of grace, of
force, or dignity in their writings, if these must always be traced
back to a previous source. One age cannot understand how another
could subsist without its lights, as one country thinks every other
must be poor for want of its physical productions. This is a narrow
and superficial view of the subject: we should by all means rise above
it. I am not for devoting the whole of our time to the study of the
classics, or of any other set of writers, to the exclusion and neglect
of nature; but I think we should turn our thoughts enough that way
to convince us of the existence of genius and learning before our time,
and to cure us of an overweening conceit of ourselves, and of a contemptuous
opinion of the world at large. Every civilised age and
country (and of these there is not one, but a hundred) has its literature,
its arts, its comforts, large and ample, though we may know
nothing of them; nor is it (except for our own sakes) important that
we should.</p>

<p class='c007'>Books have been so multiplied in our days (like the Vanity Fair
of knowledge), and we have made such progress beyond ourselves in
some points, that it seems at first glance as if we had monopolised
every possible advantage, and the rest of the world must be left
destitute and in darkness. This is the <em>cockneyism</em> (with leave be it
spoken) of the nineteenth century. There is a tone of smartness and
piquancy in modern writing, to which former examples may, in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>sense, appear flat and pedantic. Our allusions are more pointed and
personal: the ancients are, in this respect, formal and prosaic personages.
Some one, not long ago, in this vulgar, shallow spirit of
criticism (which sees every thing from its own point of view), said
that the tragedies of Sophocles and Æschylus were about as good as
the pieces brought out at Sadler’s Wells or the Adelphi Theatre.
An oration of Demosthenes is thought dry and meagre, because it is
not ‘full of wise saws and modern instances:’ one of Cicero’s is
objected to as flimsy and extravagant, for the same reason. There
is a style in one age which does not fall in with the taste of the public
in another, as it requires greater effeminacy and softness, greater
severity or simplicity, greater force or refinement. Guido was
more admired than Raphael in his day, because the manners were
grown softer without the strength: Sir Peter Lely was thought in
his to have eclipsed Vandyke—an opinion that no one holds at
present: Holbein’s faces must be allowed to be very different from
Sir Thomas Lawrence’s—yet the one was the favourite painter of
Henry VIII., as the other is of George IV. What should we say in
our time to the <em>euphuism</em> of the age of Elizabeth, when style was
made a riddle, and the court talked in conundrums? This, as a
novelty and a trial of the wits, might take for a while: afterwards, it
could only seem absurd. We must always make some allowance for
a change of style, which those who are accustomed to read none but
works written within the last twenty years neither can nor will make.
When a whole generation read, they will read none but contemporary
productions. The taste for literature becomes superficial, as it
becomes universal and is spread over a larger space. When ten
thousand boarding-school girls, who have learnt to play on the harpsichord,
are brought out in the same season, Rossini will be preferred
to Mozart, as the last new composer. I remember a very genteel
young couple in the boxes at Drury Lane being very much scandalised
some years ago at the phrase in <em>A New Way to Pay Old
Debts</em>—‘an insolent piece of paper’—applied to the contents of a
letter—it wanted the modern lightness and indifference. Let an old
book be ever so good, it treats (generally speaking) of topics that are
stale in a style that has grown ‘somewhat musty;’ of manners that
are exploded, probably by the very ridicule thus cast upon them; of
persons that no longer figure on the stage; and of interests that have
long since given place to others in the infinite fluctuations of human
affairs. Longinus complains of the want of interest in the Odyssey,
because it does not, like the Iliad, treat of war. The very complaint
we make against the latter is that it treats of nothing else; or that,
as Fuseli expresses it, every thing is seen ‘through the blaze of war.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Books of devotion are no longer read (if we read Irving’s <em>Orations</em>,
it is merely that we may go as a <em>lounge</em> to see the man): even attacks
on religion are out of date and insipid. Voltaire’s jests, and the <em>Jew’s
Letters</em> in answer (equal in wit, and more than equal in learning),
repose quietly on the shelf together. We want something in England
about Rent and the Poor Laws, and something in France about the
Charter—or Lord Byron. With the attempts, however, to revive
superstition and intolerance, a spirit of opposition has been excited, and
Pascall’s <em>Provincial Letters</em> have been once more enlisted into the service.
In France you meet with no one who has read the <cite>New Heloise</cite>: the
<em>Princess of Cleves</em> is not even mentioned in these degenerate days. Is
it not provoking with us to see the <cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite> cut down to two
acts, because some of the allusions are too broad, and others not understood?
And in America—that Van Diemen’s Land of letters—this
sterling satire is hooted off the stage, because fortunately they have no
such state of manners as it describes before their eyes; and because,
unfortunately, they have no conception of any thing but what they see.
America is singularly and awkwardly situated in this respect. It is
a new country with an old language; and while every thing about
them is of a day’s growth, they are constantly applying to us to know
what to think of it, and taking their opinions from our books and
newspapers with a strange mixture of servility and of the spirit of
contradiction. They are an independent state in politics: in literature
they are still a colony from us—not out of their leading strings, and
strangely puzzled how to determine between the Edinburgh and
Quarterly Reviews. We have naturalised some of their writers, who
had formed themselves upon us. This is at once a compliment to
them and to ourselves. Amidst the scramble and lottery for fame in
the present day, besides puffing, which may be regarded as the hotbed
of reputation, another mode has been attempted by <em>transplanting</em>
it; and writers who are set down as drivellers at home, shoot up great
authors on the other side of the water; pack up their all—a title-page
and sufficient impudence; and a work, of which the <em>flocci-nauci-nihili-pili-fication</em>,
in Shenstone’s phrase, is well known to every competent
judge, is <em>placarded</em> into eminence, and ‘flames in the forehead of the
morning sky’ on the walls of Paris or St. Petersburgh. I dare not
mention the instances, but so it is. Some reputations last only while
the possessors live, from which one might suppose that they gave
themselves a character for genius: others are cried up by their
gossiping acquaintances, as long as they give dinners, and make their
houses places of polite resort; and, in general, in our time, a book
may be considered to have passed the ordeal that is mentioned at all
three months after it is printed. Immortality is not even a dream—a boy’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>conceit; and posthumous fame is no more regarded by the
author than by his bookseller.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c008'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This idle, dissipated turn seems to be a set-off to, or the obvious
reaction of, the exclusive admiration of the ancients, which was
formerly the fashion: as if the sun of human intellect rose and set at
Rome and Athens, and the mind of man had never exerted itself to
any purpose since. The ignorant, as well as the adept, were charmed
only with what was obsolete and far-fetched, wrapped up in technical
terms and in a learned tongue. Those who spoke and wrote a
language which hardly any one at present even understood, must of
course be wiser than we. Time, that brings so many reputations to
decay, had embalmed others and rendered them sacred. From an
implicit faith and overstrained homage paid to antiquity, we of the
modern school have taken too strong a bias to what is new; and
divide all wisdom and worth between ourselves and posterity,—not a
very formidable rival to our self-love, as we attribute all its advantages
to ourselves, though we pretend to owe little or nothing to our predecessors.
About the time of the French Revolution, it was agreed
that the world had hitherto been in its dotage or its infancy; and that
Mr. Godwin, Condorcet, and others were to begin a new race of men—a
new epoch in society. Every thing up to that period was to be
set aside as puerile or barbarous; or, if there were any traces of
thought and manliness now and then discoverable, they were to be
regarded with wonder as prodigies—as irregular and fitful starts in
that long sleep of reason and night of philosophy. In this liberal
spirit Mr. Godwin composed an Essay, to prove that, till the publication
of <cite>The Enquiry concerning Political Justice</cite>, no one knew how to
write a word of common grammar, or a style that was not utterly
uncouth, incongruous, and feeble. Addison, Swift, and Junius were
included in this censure. The English language itself might be supposed
to owe its stability and consistency, its roundness and polish, to
the whirling motion of the French Revolution. Those who had
gone before us were, like our grandfathers and grandmothers, decrepit,
superannuated people, blind and dull; poor creatures, like flies in
winter, without pith or marrow in them. The past was barren of
interest—had neither thought nor object worthy to arrest our attention;
and the future would be equally a senseless void, except as we
projected ourselves and our theories into it. There is nothing I hate
more than I do this exclusive, upstart spirit.</p>

faith in excellence, all superiority—our own as well as that of others—soon
comes to the ground. By applying the wrong end of the
magnifying glass to all objects indiscriminately, the most respectable
dwindle into insignificance, and the best are confounded with the
worst. Learning, no longer supported by opinion, or genius by fame,
is cast into the mire, and ‘trampled under the hoofs of a swinish
multitude.’ I would rather endure the most blind and bigotted respect
for great and illustrious names, than that pitiful, grovelling humour
which has no pride in intellectual excellence, and no pleasure but in
decrying those who have given proofs of it, and reducing them to its
own level. If, with the diffusion of knowledge, we do not gain an
enlargement and elevation of views, where is the benefit? If, by
tearing asunder names from things, we do not leave even the name or
shadow of excellence, it is better to let them remain as they were;
for it is better to have something to admire than nothing—names, if
not things—the shadow, if not the substance—the tinsel, if not the
gold. All can now read and write equally; and, it is therefore presumed,
equally well. Any thing short of this sweeping conclusion is
an invidious distinction; and those who claim it for themselves or
others are <em>exclusionists</em> in letters. Every one at least can call names—can
invent a falsehood, or repeat a story against those who have
galled their pragmatical pretensions by really adding to the stock of
general amusement or instruction. Every one in a crowd has the
power to throw dirt: nine out of ten have the inclination. It is
curious that, in an age when the most universally-admitted claim to
public distinction is literary merit, the attaining of this distinction is
almost a sure title to public contempt and obloquy.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c008'><sup>[36]</sup></a> They cry you
up, because you are unknown, and do not excite their jealousy; and
run you down, when they have thus distinguished you, out of envy
and spleen at the very idol they have set up. A public favourite is
‘kept like an apple in the jaw of an ape—first mouthed, to be afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>swallowed. When they need what you have gleaned, it is but
squeezing you, and spunge, you shall be dry again.’ At first they
think only of the pleasure or advantage they receive; but, on reflection,
they are mortified at the superiority implied in this involuntary
concession, and are determined to be even with you the very first
opportunity. What is the prevailing spirit of modern literature? To
defame men of letters. What are the publications that succeed?
Those that pretend to teach the public that the persons they have
been accustomed unwittingly to look up to as the lights of the earth
are no better than themselves, or a set of vagabonds or miscreants that
should be hunted out of society.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c008'><sup>[37]</sup></a> Hence men of letters, losing their
self-respect, become government-tools, and prostitute their talents to
the most infamous purposes, or turn <em>dandy scribblers</em>, and set up for
gentlemen authors in their own defence. I like the Order of the
Jesuits better than this: they made themselves respected by the laity,
kept their own secret, and did not prey on one another. Resume
then, oh! Learning, thy robe pontifical; clothe thyself in pride and
purple; join the sacred to the profane; wield both worlds; instead
of twopenny trash and mechanics’ magazines, issue bulls and decretals;
say not, let there be light, but darkness visible; draw a bandage over
the eyes of the ignorant and unlettered; hang the terrors of superstition
and despotism over them;—and for thy pains they will bless
thee: children will pull off their caps as thou dost pass; women will
courtesy; the old will wipe their beards; and thou wilt rule once
more over the base serving people, clowns, and nobles, with a rod of
iron!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ON DISAGREEABLE PEOPLE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Monthly Magazine.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>August, 1827.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>Those people who are uncomfortable in themselves are disagreeable to
others. I do not here mean to speak of persons who offend intentionally,
or are obnoxious to dislike from some palpable defect of
mind or body, ugliness, pride, ill-humour, &#38;c.,—but of those who are
disagreeable in spite of themselves, and, as it might appear, with
almost every qualification to recommend them to others. This want
of success is owing chiefly to something in what is called their <em>manner</em>;
and this again has its foundation in a certain cross-grained and
unsociable state of feeling on their part, which influences us, perhaps,
without our distinctly adverting to it. The mind is a finer instrument
than we sometimes suppose it, and is not only swayed by overt acts and
tangible proofs, but has an instinctive feeling of the air of truth. We
find many individuals in whose company we pass our time, and have
no particular fault to find with their understandings or character, and
yet we are never thoroughly satisfied with them: the reason will turn
out to be, upon examination, that they are never thoroughly satisfied
with themselves, but uneasy and out of sorts all the time; and this
makes us uneasy with them, without our reflecting on, or being able
to discover the cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, for instance, we meet with persons who do us a number of
kindnesses, who shew us every mark of respect and good-will, who
are friendly and serviceable,—and yet we do not feel grateful to them,
after all. We reproach ourselves with this as caprice or insensibility,
and try to get the better of it; but there is something in their way
of doing things that prevents us from feeling cordial or sincerely
obliged to them. We think them very worthy people, and would
be glad of an opportunity to do them a good turn if it were in
our power; but we cannot get beyond this: the utmost we can do is
to save appearances, and not come to an open rupture with them.
The truth is, in all such cases, we do not sympathise (as we ought)
with them, because they do not sympathise (as they ought) with us.
They have done what they did from a sense of duty in a cold dry
manner, or from a meddlesome busybody humour; or to shew their
superiority over us, or to patronise our infirmity; or they have
dropped some hint by the way, or blundered upon some topic they
should not, and have shewn, by one means or other, that they were
occupied with any thing but the pleasure they were affording us, or a
delicate attention to our feelings. Such persons may be styled <em>friendly
grievances</em>. They are commonly people of low spirits and disappointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>views, who see the discouraging side of human life, and, with the
best intentions in the world, contrive to make every thing they have
to do with uncomfortable. They are alive to your distress, and take
pains to remove it; but they have no satisfaction in the gaiety and
ease they have communicated, and are on the <em>look-out</em> for some new
occasion of signalizing their zeal; nor are they backward to insinuate
that you will soon have need of their assistance, to guard you against
running into fresh difficulties, or to extricate you from them. From
large benevolence of soul and ‘discourse of reason, looking before
and after,’ they are continually reminding you of something that has
gone wrong in time past, or that may do so in that which is to come,
and are surprised that their awkward hints, sly inuendos, blunt
questions, and solemn features do not excite all the complacency and
mutual good understanding in you which it is intended that they
should. When they make themselves miserable on your account, it
is hard that you will not lend them your countenance and support.
This deplorable humour of theirs does not hit any one else. They
are useful, but not agreeable people; they may assist you in your
affairs, but they depress and tyrannise over your feelings. When they
have made you happy, they will not let you be so—have no enjoyment
of the good they have done—will on no account part with their
melancholy and desponding tone—and, by their mawkish insensibility
and doleful grimaces, throw a damp over the triumph they are called
upon to celebrate. They would keep you in hot water, that they
may help you out of it. They will nurse you in a fit of sickness
(congenial sufferers!)—arbitrate a law-suit for you, and embroil you
deeper—procure you a loan of money;—but all the while they are
only delighted with rubbing the sore place, and casting the colour of
your mental or other disorders. ‘The whole need not a physician;’
and, being once placed at ease and comfort, they have no farther use
for you as subjects for their singular beneficence, and you are not
sorry to be quit of their tiresome interference. The old proverb, <em>A
friend in need is a friend indeed</em>, is not verified in them. The class of
persons here spoken of are the very reverse of <em>summer-friends</em>, who
court you in prosperity, flatter your vanity, are the humble servants of
your follies, never see or allude to any thing wrong, minister to your
gaiety, smooth over every difficulty, and, with the slightest approach
of misfortune or of any thing unpleasant, take French leave:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘As when, in prime of June, a burnished fly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sprung from the meads, o’er which he sweeps along,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cheered by the breathing bloom and vital sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tunes up amid these airy halls his song,</div>
      <div class='line'>Soothing at first the gay reposing throng;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>And oft he sips their bowl, or nearly drowned,</div>
      <div class='line'>He thence recovering drives their beds among,</div>
      <div class='line'>And scares their tender sleep with trump profound;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then out again he flies to wing his mazy round.’</div>
      <div class='line in24'><span class='sc'>Thomson’s Castle of Indolence.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>However we may despise such triflers, yet we regret them more than
those well-meaning friends on whom a dull melancholy vapour hangs,
that drags them and every one about them to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, there are those who might be very agreeable people, if they
had but spirit to be so; but there is a narrow, unaspiring, under-bred
tone in all they say or do. They have great sense and information—abound
in a knowledge of character—have a fund of anecdote—are
unexceptionable in manners and appearance—and yet we cannot make
up our minds to like them: we are not glad to see them, nor sorry
when they go away. Our familiarity with them, however great,
wants the principle of cement, which is a certain appearance of frank
cordiality and social enjoyment. They have no pleasure in the
subjects of their own thoughts, and therefore can communicate none
to others. There is a dry, husky, grating manner—a pettiness of
detail—a tenaciousness of particulars, however trifling or unpleasant—a
disposition to cavil—an aversion to enlarged and liberal views of
things—in short, a hard, painful, unbending <em>matter-of-factness</em>, from
which the spirit and effect are banished, and the letter only is attended
to, which makes it impossible to sympathise with their discourse.
To make conversation interesting or agreeable, there is required either
the habitual tone of good company, which gives a favourable colouring
to every thing—or the warmth and enthusiasm of genius, which,
though it may occasionally offend or be thrown off its guard, makes
amends by its rapturous flights, and flings a glancing light upon all
things. The literal and <em>dogged</em> style of conversation resembles that
of a French picture, or its mechanical fidelity is like evidence given
in a court of justice, or a police report.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the literal to the plain-spoken, the transition is easy. The
most efficient weapon of offence is truth. Those who deal in dry and
repulsive matters-of-fact, tire out their friends; those who blurt out
hard and home truths, make themselves mortal enemies wherever they
come. There are your blunt, honest creatures, who omit no opportunity
of letting you know their minds, and are sure to tell you all the
ill, and conceal all the good they hear of you. They would not
flatter you for the world, and to caution you against the malice of
others, they think the province of a friend. This is not candour, but
impudence; and yet they think it odd you are not charmed with their
unreserved communicativeness of disposition. Gossips and tale-bearers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>on the contrary, who supply the <em>tittle-tattle</em> of the neighbourhood,
flatter you to your face, and laugh at you behind your back, are
welcome and agreeable guests in all companies. Though you know
it will be your turn next, yet for the sake of the immediate gratification,
you are contented to pay your share of the public tax upon
character, and are better pleased with the falsehoods that never reach
your ears, than with the truths that others (less complaisant and more
sincere) utter to your face—so short-sighted and willing to be
imposed upon is our self-love! There is a man, who has the air of
not being convinced without an argument: you avoid him as if he
were a lion in your path. There is another, who asks you fifty
questions as to the commonest things you advance: you would sooner
pardon a fellow who held a pistol to your breast and demanded your
money. No one regards a turnpike-keeper, or a custom-house officer,
with a friendly eye: he who stops you in an excursion of fancy, or
ransacks the articles of your belief obstinately and churlishly, to
distinguish the spurious from the genuine, is still more your foe.
These inquisitors and cross-examiners upon system make ten enemies
for every controversy in which they engage. The world dread nothing
so much as being convinced of their errors. In doing them this piece
of service, you make war equally on their prejudices, their interests,
their pride, and indolence. You not only set up for a superiority of
understanding over them, which they hate, but you deprive them of
their ordinary grounds of action, their topics of discourse, of their
confidence in themselves, and those to whom they have been
accustomed to look up for instruction and advice. It is making
children of them. You unhinge all their established opinions and
trains of thought; and after leaving them in this listless, vacant,
unsettled state—dissatisfied with their own notions and shocked at
yours—you expect them to court and be delighted with your company,
because, forsooth, you have only expressed your sincere and conscientious
convictions. Mankind are not deceived by professions,
unless they choose. They think that this pill of true doctrine,
however it may be gilded over, is full of gall and bitterness to them;
and, again, it is a maxim of which the vulgar are firmly persuaded,
that plain-speaking (as it is called) is, nine parts in ten, spleen and
self-opinion; and the other part, perhaps, honesty. Those who will
not abate an inch in argument, and are always seeking to recover the
wind of you, are, in the eye of the world, disagreeable, unconscionable
people, who ought to be <em>sent to Coventry</em>, or left to wrangle by
themselves. No persons, however, are more averse to contradiction
than these same dogmatists. What shews our susceptibility on this
point is, there is no flattery so adroit or effectual as that of implicit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>assent. Any one, however mean his capacity or ill-qualified to judge,
who gives way to all our sentiments, and never seems to think but as
we do, is indeed an <i><span lang="la">alter idem</span></i>—another self; and we admit him
without scruple into our entire confidence, ‘yea, into our heart of
hearts.’</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the same in books. Those which, under the disguise of
plain-speaking, vent paradoxes, and set their faces against the
common sense of mankind, are neither ‘the volumes</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>——‘That enrich the shops,</div>
      <div class='line'>That pass with approbation through the land;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>nor, I fear, can it be added—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That bring their authors an immortal fame.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>They excite a clamour and opposition at first, and are in general
soon consigned to oblivion. Even if the opinions are in the end
adopted, the authors gain little by it, and their names remain in their
original obloquy; for the public will own no obligations to such
ungracious benefactors. In like manner, there are many books
written in a very delightful vein, though with little in them, and that
are accordingly popular. Their principle is to please, and not to
offend; and they succeed in both objects. We are contented with
the deference shown to our feelings for the time, and grant a truce
both to wit and wisdom. The ‘courteous reader’ and the good-natured
author are well matched in this instance, and find their account
in mutual tenderness and forbearance to each other’s infirmities. I
am not sure that Walton’s Angler is not a book of this last description—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That dallies with the innocence of thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the old age.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Hobbes and Mandeville are in the opposite extreme, and have met
with a correspondent fate. The Tatler and the Spectator are in the
golden mean, carry instruction as far as it can go without shocking,
and give the most exquisite pleasure without one particle of pain.
‘<em>Desire to please, and you will infallibly please</em>,’ is a maxim equally
applicable to the study or the drawing-room. Thus also we see
actors of very small pretensions, and who have scarce any other merit
than that of being on good terms with themselves, and in high good
humour with their parts (though they hardly understand a word of
them), who are universal favourites with the audience. Others,
who are masters of their art, and in whom no slip or flaw can be
detected, you have no pleasure in seeing, from something dry,
repulsive, and unconciliating in their manner; and you almost hate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>very mention of their names, as an unavailing appeal to your candid
decision in their favour, and as taxing you with injustice for refusing it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may observe persons who seem to take a peculiar delight in
the <em>disagreeable</em>. They catch all sorts of uncouth tones and gestures,
the manners and dialect of clowns and hoydens, and aim at vulgarity
as desperately as others ape gentility. [This is what is often understood
by a <em>love of low life</em>.] They say the most unwarrantable things,
without meaning or feeling what they say. What startles or shocks
other people, is to them a sport—an amusing excitement—a fillip to
their constitutions; and from the bluntness of their perceptions, and
a certain wilfulness of spirit, not being able to enter into the refined
and agreeable, they make a merit of despising every thing of the kind.
Masculine women, for example, are those who, not being distinguished
by the charms and delicacy of the sex, affect a superiority over it by
throwing aside all decorum. We also find another class, who
continually do and say what they ought not, and what they do not
intend, and who are governed almost entirely by an instinct of
absurdity. Owing to a perversity of imagination or irritability of
nerve, the idea that a thing is improper acts as a provocation to it:
the fear of committing a blunder is so strong, that in their agitation
they <em>bolt</em> out whatever is uppermost in their minds, before they are
aware of the consequence. The dread of something wrong haunts
and rivets their attention to it; and an uneasy, morbid apprehensiveness
of temper takes away their self-possession, and hurries them into
the very mistakes they are most anxious to avoid.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we look about us, and ask who are the agreeable and disagreeable
people in the world, we shall see that it does not depend on their
virtues or vices—their understanding or stupidity—but as much on
the degree of pleasure or pain they seem to feel in ordinary social
intercourse. What signify all the good qualities any one possesses, if
he is none the better for them himself? If the cause is so delightful,
the effect ought to be so too. We enjoy a friend’s society only in
proportion as he is satisfied with ours. Even wit, however it may
startle, is only agreeable as it is sheathed in good-humour. There are
a kind of <em>intellectual stammerers</em>, who are delivered of their good
things with pain and effort; and consequently what costs them such
evident uneasiness does not impart unmixed delight to the bystanders.
There are those, on the contrary, whose sallies cost them nothing—who
abound in a flow of pleasantry and good-humour; and who float
down the stream with them carelessly and triumphantly,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Wit at the helm, and Pleasure at the prow.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps it may be said of English wit in general, that it too much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>resembles pointed lead: after all, there is something heavy and dull
in it! The race of small wits are not the least agreeable people in
the world. They have their little joke to themselves, enjoy it, and
do not set up any preposterous pretensions to thwart the current of
our self-love. Toad-eating is accounted a thriving profession; and a
<em>butt</em>, according to the Spectator, is a highly useful member of society—as
one who takes whatever is said of him in good part, and as
necessary to conduct off the spleen and superfluous petulance of the
company. Opposed to these are the swaggering bullies—the licensed
wits—the free-thinkers—the loud talkers, who, in the jockey phrase,
have <em>lost their mouths</em>, and cannot be reined in by any regard to
decency or common sense. The more obnoxious the subject, the
more are they charmed with it, converting their want of feeling into
a proof of superiority to vulgar prejudice and squeamish affectation.
But there is an unseemly exposure of the mind, as well as of the
body. There are some objects that shock the sense, and cannot with
propriety be mentioned: there are naked truths that offend the mind,
and ought to be kept out of sight as much as possible. For human
nature cannot bear to be too hardly pressed upon. One of these
cynical truisms, when brought forward to the world, may be forgiven
as a slip of the pen: a succession of them, denoting a deliberate
purpose and <em>malice prepense</em>, must ruin any writer. Lord Byron had
got into an irregular course of these a little before his death—seemed
desirous, in imitation of Mr. Shelley, to run the gauntlet of public
obloquy—and, at the same time, wishing to screen himself from the
censure he defied, dedicated his Cain to Sir Walter Scott—a pretty
godfather to such a bantling!</p>

<p class='c007'>Some persons are of so teazing and fidgetty a turn of mind, that
they do not give you a moment’s rest. Every thing goes wrong with
them. They complain of a headache or the weather. They take up
a book, and lay it down again—venture an opinion, and retract it
before they have half done—offer to serve you, and prevent some one
else from doing it. If you dine with them at a tavern, in order to be
more at your ease, the fish is too little done—the sauce is not the
right one; they ask for a sort of wine which they think is not to be
had, or if it is, after some trouble, procured, do not touch it; they
give the waiter fifty contradictory orders, and are restless and sit on
thorns the whole of dinner-time. All this is owing to a want of
robust health, and of a strong spirit of enjoyment; it is a fastidious
habit of mind, produced by a valetudinary habit of body: they are
out of sorts with every thing, and of course their ill-humour and
captiousness communicates itself to you, who are as little delighted
with them as they are with other things. Another sort of people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>equally objectionable with this helpless class, who are disconcerted
by a shower of rain or stopped by an insect’s wing, are those who, in
the opposite spirit, will have every thing their own way, and carry all
before them—who cannot brook the slightest shadow of opposition—who
are always in the heat of an argument—who knit their brows and
clench their teeth in some speculative discussion, as if they were
engaged in a personal quarrel—and who, though successful over
almost every competitor, seem still to resent the very offer of resistance
to their supposed authority, and are as angry as if they had
sustained some premeditated injury. There is an impatience of
temper and an intolerance of opinion in this that conciliates neither
our affection nor esteem. To such persons nothing appears of any
moment but the indulgence of a domineering intellectual superiority to
the disregard and discomfiture of their own and every body else’s
comfort. Mounted on an abstract proposition, they trample on every
courtesy and decency of behaviour; and though, perhaps, they do
not intend the gross personalities they are guilty of, yet they cannot
be acquitted of a want of due consideration for others, and of an
intolerable egotism in the support of truth and justice. You may hear
one of these Quixotic declaimers pleading the cause of humanity in a
voice of thunder, or expatiating on the beauty of a Guido with
features distorted with rage and scorn. This is not a very amiable or
edifying spectacle.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are persons who cannot make friends. Who are they?
Those who cannot be friends. It is not the want of understanding
or good-nature, of entertaining or useful qualities, that you complain
of: on the contrary, they have probably many points of attraction;
but they have one that neutralises all these—they care nothing about
you, and are neither the better nor worse for what you think of them.
They manifest no joy at your approach; and when you leave them, it
is with a feeling that they can do just as well without you. This is
not sullenness, nor indifference, nor absence of mind; but they are
intent solely on their own thoughts, and you are merely one of the
subjects they exercise them upon. They live in society as in a
solitude; and, however their brain works, their pulse beats neither
faster nor slower for the common accidents of life. There is,
therefore, something cold and repulsive in the air that is about them—like
that of marble. In a word, they are <em>modern philosophers</em>; and
the modern philosopher is what the pedant was of old—a being who
lives in a world of his own, and has no correspondence with this. It
is not that such persons have not done you services—you acknowledge
it; it is not that they have said severe things of you—you submit to
it as a necessary evil: but it is the cool manner in which the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>is done that annoys you—the speculating upon you, as if you were
nobody—the regarding you, with a view to experiment <em>in corpore vili</em>—the
principle of dissection—the determination to spare no blemishes—to
cut you down to your real standard;—in short, the utter absence
of the partiality of friendship, the blind enthusiasm of affection, or the
delicacy of common decency, that whether they ‘hew you as a carcase
fit for hounds, or carve you as a dish fit for the gods,’ the operation
on your feelings and your sense of obligation is just the same; and,
whether they are demons or angels in themselves, you wish them
equally <em>at the devil</em>!</p>

<p class='c007'>Other persons of worth and sense give way to mere violence of
temperament (with which the understanding has nothing to do)—are
burnt up with a perpetual fury—repel and throw you to a distance by
their restless, whirling motion—so that you dare not go near them, or
feel as uneasy in their company as if you stood on the edge of a
volcano. They have their <em>tempora mollia fandi</em>; but then what a stir
may you not expect the next moment! Nothing is less inviting or
less comfortable than this state of uncertainty and apprehension.
Then there are those who never approach you without the most
alarming advice or information, telling you that you are in a dying
way, or that your affairs are on the point of ruin, by way of disburthening
their consciences; and others, who give you to understand
much the same thing as a good joke, out of sheer impertinence,
constitutional vivacity, and want of something to say. All these, it
must be confessed, are disagreeable people; and you repay their overanxiety
or total forgetfulness of you, by a determination to cut them
as speedily as possible. We meet with instances of persons who
overpower you by a sort of boisterous mirth and rude animal spirits,
with whose ordinary state of excitement it is as impossible to keep up
as with that of any one really intoxicated; and with others who seem
scarce alive—who take no pleasure or interest in any thing—who are
born to exemplify the maxim,</p>

<p class='c013'>and whose mawkish insensibility or sullen scorn are equally annoying.
In general, all people brought up in remote country places, where life
is crude and harsh—all sectaries—all partisans of a losing cause, are
discontented and disagreeable. Commend me above all to the
Westminster School of Reform, whose blood runs as cold in their
veins as the torpedo’s, and whose touch jars like it. Catholics are,
upon the whole, more amiable than Protestants—foreigners than
English people. Among ourselves, the Scotch, as a nation, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>particularly disagreeable. They hate every appearance of comfort
themselves, and refuse it to others. Their climate, their religion,
and their habits are equally averse to pleasure. Their manners are
either distinguished by a fawning sycophancy (to gain their own ends,
and conceal their natural defects), that makes one sick; or by a
morose unbending callousness, that makes one shudder. I had
forgot to mention two other descriptions of persons who fall under
the scope of this essay:—those who take up a subject, and run on
with it interminably, without knowing whether their hearers care one
word about it, or in the least minding what reception their oratory
meets with—these are pretty generally voted <em>bores</em> (mostly German
ones);—and others, who may be designated as practical paradox-mongers—who
discard the ‘milk of human kindness,’ and an attention
to common observances, from all their actions, as effeminate and
puling—who wear a white hat as a mark of superior understanding,
and carry home a handkerchief-full of mushrooms in the top of it as
an original discovery—who give you craw-fish for supper instead of
lobsters; seek their company in a garret, and over a gin-bottle,
to avoid the imputation of affecting genteel society; and discard
them after a term of years, and warn others against them, as being
<em>honest fellows</em>, which is thought a vulgar prejudice. This is carrying
the harsh and repulsive even beyond the disagreeable—to the hateful.
Such persons are generally people of common-place understandings,
obtuse feelings, and inordinate vanity. They are formidable if they
get you in their power—otherwise, they are only to be laughed at.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are a vast number who are disagreeable from meanness of
spirit, from downright insolence, from slovenliness of dress or disgusting
tricks, from folly or ignorance: but these causes are positive moral or
physical defects, and I only meant to speak of that repulsiveness of
manners which arises from want of tact and sympathy with others.
So far of friendship: a word, if I durst, of love. Gallantry to
women (the sure road to their favour) is nothing but the appearance
of extreme devotion to all their wants and wishes—a delight in their
satisfaction, and a confidence in yourself, as being able to contribute
towards it. The slightest indifference with regard to them, or
distrust of yourself, are equally fatal. The amiable is the voluptuous
in looks, manner, or words. No face that exhibits this kind of
expression—whether lively or serious, obvious or suppressed, will be
thought ugly—no address, awkward—no lover who approaches every
woman he meets as his mistress, will be unsuccessful. Diffidence and
awkwardness are the two antidotes to love.</p>

<p class='c007'>To please universally, we must be pleased with ourselves and others.
There should be a tinge of the coxcomb, an oil of self-complacency,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>an anticipation of success—there should be no gloom, no moroseness
no shyness—in short, there should be very little of an Englishman,
and a good deal of a Frenchman. But though, I believe, this is the
receipt, we are none the nearer making use of it. It is impossible
for those who are naturally disagreeable ever to become otherwise.
This is some consolation, as it may save a world of useless pains and
anxiety. ‘<em>Desire to please, and you will infallibly please</em>,’ is a true
maxim; but it does not follow that it is in the power of all to practise
it. A vain man, who thinks he is endeavouring to please, is only
endeavouring to shine, and is still farther from the mark. An
irritable man, who puts a check upon himself, only grows dull, and
loses spirit to be any thing. Good temper and a happy spirit
(which are the indispensable requisites) can no more be commanded
than good health or good looks; and though the plain and sickly
need not distort their features, and may abstain from success, this is all
they can do. The utmost a disagreeable person can do is to hope to
be less disagreeable than with care and study he might become, and
to pass unnoticed in society. With this negative character he should
be contented, and may build his fame and happiness on other things.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will conclude with a character of men who neither please nor
aspire to please anybody, and who can come in nowhere so properly
as at the fag-end of an essay:—I mean that class of discontented but
amusing persons, who are infatuated with their own ill success, and
reduced to despair by a lucky turn in their favour. While all goes
well, they are <em>like fish out of water</em>. They have no reliance on or
sympathy with their good fortune, and look upon it as a momentary
delusion. Let a doubt be thrown on the question, and they begin to
be full of lively apprehensions again: let all their hopes vanish, and
they feel themselves on firm ground once more. From want of spirit
or of habit, their imaginations cannot rise above the low ground of
humility—cannot reflect the gay, flaunting tints of the fancy—flag
and droop into despondency—and can neither indulge the expectation,
nor employ the means of success. Even when it is within their reach,
they dare not lay hands upon it; and shrink from unlooked-for bursts
of prosperity, as something of which they are both ashamed and
unworthy. The class of <em>croakers</em> here spoken of are less delighted at
other people’s misfortunes than their own. Their neighbours may
have some pretensions—they have none. Querulous complaints and
anticipations of discomfort are the food on which they live; and they
at last acquire a passion for that which is the favourite theme of their
thoughts, and can no more do without it than without the pinch of
snuff with which they season their conversation, and enliven the
pauses of their daily prognostics.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible to have things done without doing them. This
seems a truism; and yet what is more common than to suppose that
we shall find things done, merely by wishing it? <em>To put the will for
the deed</em> is as usual in practice as it is contrary to common sense.
There is, in fact, no absurdity, no contradiction, of which the mind
is not capable. This weakness is, I think, more remarkable in the
English than in any other people, in whom (to judge by what I discover
in myself) the will bears great and disproportioned sway. We
desire a thing: we contemplate the end intently, and think it done,
neglecting the necessary means to accomplish it. The strong tendency
of the mind towards it, the internal effort it makes to give birth to the
object of its idolatry, seems an adequate cause to produce the wished-for
effect, and is in a manner identified with it. This is more particularly
the case in what relates to the <em>Fine Arts</em>, and will account
for some phenomena in the national character.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English style is distinguished by what are called <em>ébauches</em><a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c008'><sup>[38]</sup></a>—rude
sketches, or violent attempts at effect, with a total inattention to the
details or delicacy of finishing. Now this, I apprehend, proceeds not
exactly from grossness of perception, but from the wilfulness of our
characters, our determination to have every thing our own way without
any trouble, or delay, or distraction of mind. An object strikes us:
we see and feel the whole effect at once. We wish to produce a likeness
of it; but we wish to transfer the impression to the canvas as it is
conveyed to us, simultaneously and intuitively—that is, to stamp it there
at a blow—or, otherwise, we turn away with impatience and disgust,
as if the means were an obstacle to the end, and every attention to the
mechanical process were a deviation from our original purpose. We
thus degenerate, by repeated failures, into a slovenly style of art; and
that which was at first an undisciplined and irregular impulse, becomes
a habit, and then a theory. It seems a little strange that the zealous
devotion to the end should produce aversion to the means; but so it
is: neither is it, however irrational, altogether unnatural. That which
we are struck with, which we are enamoured of, is the general appearance
or result; and it would certainly be most desirable to produce
the effect we aim at by a word or wish, if it were possible, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>being taken up with the mechanical drudgery or pettiness of detail, or
dexterity of execution, which, though they are essential and component
parts of the work, do not enter into our thoughts, or form any
part of our contemplation. In a word, the hand does not keep pace
with the eye; and it is the desire that it should, that causes all the
contradiction and confusion. We would have a face to start out from
the canvas at once—not feature by feature, or touch by touch; we
would be glad to convey an attitude or a divine expression to the
spectator by a stroke of the pencil, as it is conveyed by a glance of
the eye, or by the magic of feeling, independently of measurements,
and distances, and foreshortening, and numberless minute particulars,
and all the instrumentality of the art. We may find it necessary, on
a cool calculation, to go through and make ourselves masters of these;
but, in so doing, we submit only to necessity, and they are still a
diversion to, and a suspension of, our favourite purpose for the time—at
least unless practice has given that facility which almost identifies
the two together, and makes the process an unconscious one. The
end thus devours up the means; or our eagerness for the one, where
it is strong and unchecked, renders us in proportion impatient of the
other. So we view an object at a distance, which excites in us an
inclination to visit it: this, after many tedious steps and intricate
windings, we do; but, if we could fly, we should never consent to go
on foot. The mind, however, has wings, though the body has not;
and, wherever the imagination can come into play, our desires outrun
their accomplishment. Persons of this extravagant humour should
addict themselves to eloquence or poetry, where the thought ‘leaps at
once to its effect,’ and is wafted, in a metaphor or an apostrophe,
‘from Indus to the Pole;’ though even there we should find enough,
in the preparatory and mechanical parts of those arts, to try our
patience and mortify our vanity! The first and strongest impulse of
the mind is to achieve any object, on which it is set, at once, and by
the shortest and most decisive means; but, as this cannot always be
done, we ought not to neglect other more indirect and subordinate
aids; nor should we be tempted to do so, but that the delusions of
the will interfere with the convictions of the understanding, and what
we ardently wish, we fancy to be both possible and true. Let us
take the instance of copying a fine picture. We are full of the effect
we intend to produce; and so powerfully does this prepossession
affect us, that we imagine we have produced it, in spite of the evidence
of our senses and the suggestions of friends. In truth, after a number
of violent and anxious efforts to strike off a resemblance which we
passionately long for, it seems an injustice not to have succeeded; it
is too late to retrace our steps, and begin over again in a different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>method; we prefer even failure to arriving at our end by petty,
mechanical tricks and rules; we have copied Titian or Rubens in the
spirit in which they ought to be copied; though the likeness may not
be perfect, there is a look, a tone, a <em>something</em>, which we chiefly aimed
at, and which we persuade ourselves, seeing the copy only through
the dazzled, hectic flush of feverish imagination, we have really
given; and thus we persist, and make fifty excuses, sooner than own
our error, which would imply its abandonment; or, if the light breaks
in upon us, through all the disguises of sophistry and self-love, it is so
painful that we shut our eyes to it. The more evident our failure,
the more desperate the struggles we make to conceal it from ourselves,
to stick to our original determination, and end where we began.</p>

<p class='c007'>What makes me think that this is the real stumbling-block in our way,
and not mere rusticity or want of discrimination, is that you will see
an English artist admiring and thrown into downright raptures by the
tucker of Titian’s <cite>Mistress</cite>, made up of an infinite number of little
delicate folds; and, if he attempts to copy it, he proceeds deliberately
to omit all these details, and dash it off by a single smear of his brush.
This is not ignorance, or even laziness, I conceive, so much as what
is called <em>jumping at a conclusion</em>. It is, in a word, an overweening
presumption. ‘A wilful man must have his way.’ He sees the
details, the varieties, and their effect: he sees and is charmed with
all this; but he would reproduce it with the same rapidity and unembarrassed
freedom that he sees it—or not at all. He scorns the slow
but sure method, to which others conform, as tedious and inanimate.
The mixing his colours, the laying in the ground, the giving all his
attention to a minute break or nice gradation in the several lights and
shades, is a mechanical and endless operation, very different from the
delight he feels in studying the effect of all these, when properly and
ably executed. <i><span lang="la">Quam nihil ad tuum, Papiniane, ingenium!</span></i> Such
fooleries are foreign to his refined taste and lofty enthusiasm; and a
doubt crosses his mind, in the midst of his warmest raptures, how
Titian could resolve upon the drudgery of going through them, or
whether it was not rather owing to extreme facility of hand, and a
sort of trick in laying on the colours, abridging the mechanical labour!
No one wrote or talked more eloquently about Titian’s harmony and
clearness of colouring than the late Mr. Barry—discoursing of his
greens, his blues, his yellows, ‘the little red and white of which he
composed his flesh-colour,’ <i><span lang="it">con amore</span></i>; yet his own colouring was
dead and dingy, and, if he had copied a Titian, he would have made
it a mere daub, leaving out all that caused his wonder or admiration,
or that induced him to copy it after the English or Irish fashion.
We not only grudge the labour of beginning, but we stop short, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the same reason, when we are near touching the goal of success, and,
to save a few last touches, leave a work unfinished and an object
unattained. The immediate steps, the daily gradual improvement,
the successive completion of parts, give us no pleasure; we strain at
the final result; we wish to have the whole done, and, in our anxiety
to get it off our hands, say <em>it will do</em>, and lose the benefit of all our
pains by stinting a little more, and being unable to command a little
patience. In a day or two, we will suppose, a copy of a fine Titian
would be as like as we could make it: the prospect of this so enchants
us, that we skip the intervening space, see no great use in going on
with it, fancy that we may spoil it, and, in order to put an end to the
question, take it home with us, where we immediately see our error,
and spend the rest of our lives in regretting that we did not finish it
properly when we were about it. We can execute only a part; we
see the whole of nature or of a picture at once. <em>Hinc illæ lachrymæ.</em>
The English grasp at this whole—nothing less interests or contents
them; and, in aiming at too much, they miss their object altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'>A French artist, on the contrary, has none of this uneasy, anxious
feeling—of this desire to master the whole of his subject, and anticipate
his good fortune at a blow—of this <em>massing</em> and concentrating
principle. He takes the thing more easy and rationally. He has
none of the mental qualms, the nervous agitation, the wild, desperate
plunges and convulsive throes of the English artist. He does not set
off headlong without knowing where he is going, and find himself up
to the neck in all sorts of difficulties and absurdities, from impatience
to begin and have the matter off his mind (as if it were an evil conscience);
but takes time to consider, arranges his plans, gets in his
outline and his distances, and lays a foundation before he attempts a
superstructure which he may have to pull in pieces again, or let it
remain—a monument of his folly. <em>He looks before he leaps</em>, which is
contrary to the true blindfold English rule; and I should think that
we had invented this proverb from seeing so many fatal examples of
the violation of it. Suppose he undertakes to make a copy of a
picture: he first looks at it, and sees what it is. He does not make
his sketch all black or all white, because one part of it is so, and
because he cannot alter an idea he has once got into his head and
must always run into extremes, but varies his tints (strange as it may
seem) from green to red, from orange-tawny to yellow, from grey
to brown, according as they vary in the original. He sees no inconsistency,
no forfeiture of a principle, in this (any more than Mr.
Southey in the change of the colours of his coat), but a great deal of
right reason, and indeed an absolute necessity for it, if he wishes to
succeed in what he is about. This is the last thing in an Englishman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>thoughts: he only wishes to have his own way, though it ends in
defeat and ruin—strives hard to do what he is sensible he cannot—or,
if he finds he can, gives over and leaves the matter short of a
triumphant conclusion, which is too flattering an idea for him to
indulge in. The French artist proceeds with due deliberation, and
bit by bit. He takes some one part—a hand, an eye, a piece of
drapery, an object in the back-ground—and finishes it carefully; then
another, and so on to the end. When he has gone through every
part, his picture is done: there is nothing more that he can add to it;
it is a numerical calculation, and there are only so many items in the
account. An Englishman may go on <em>slobbering</em> his over for the
hundredth time, and be no nearer than when he began. As he tries
to finish the whole at once, and as this is not possible, he always
leaves his work in an imperfect state, or as if he had begun on a new
canvas—like a man who is determined to leap to the top of a tower,
instead of scaling it step by step, and who is necessarily thrown on
his back every time he repeats the experiment. Again, the French
student does not, from a childish impatience, when he is near the end,
destroy the effect of the whole, by leaving some one part eminently
deficient, an eye-sore to the rest; nor does he fly from what he is
about, to any thing else that happens to catch his eye, neglecting the
one and spoiling the other. He is, in our old poet’s phrase, ‘constrained
by mastery,’ by the mastery of common sense and pleasurable
feeling. He is in no hurry to get to the end; for he has a satisfaction
in the work, and touches and retouches perhaps a single head,
day after day and week after week, without repining, uneasiness, or
apparent progress. The very lightness and buoyancy of his feeling
renders him (where the necessity of this is pointed out) patient and
laborious. An Englishman, whatever he undertakes, is as if he was
carrying a heavy load that oppresses both his body and mind, and
that he is anxious to throw down as soon as possible. The Frenchman’s
hopes and fears are not excited to a pitch of intolerable agony,
so that he is compelled, in mere compassion to himself, to bring the
question to a speedy issue, even to the loss of his object. He is
calm, easy, collected, and takes his time and improves his advantages
as they occur, with vigilance and alacrity. Pleased with
himself, he is pleased with whatever occupies his attention nearly
alike. He is never taken at a disadvantage. Whether he paints
an angel or a joint-stool, it is much the same to him: whether it is
landscape or history, still it is he who paints it. Nothing puts him
out of his way, for nothing puts him out of conceit with himself.
This self-complacency forms an admirable ground-work for moderation
and docility in certain particulars, though not in others.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>I remember an absurd instance enough of this deliberate mode
of setting to work in a young French artist, who was copying the
Titian’s <cite>Mistress</cite> in the Louvre, some twenty years ago. After
getting in his chalk-outline, one would think he might have been
attracted to the face—that heaven of beauty (as it appears to some),
clear, transparent, open, breathing freshness, that ‘makes a sunshine
in the shady place’; or to the lustre of the golden hair; or some
part of the poetry of the picture (for, with all its materiality, this
picture has a poetry about it); instead of which he began to finish
a square he had marked out in the right-hand corner of the picture,
containing a piece of board and a bottle of some kind of ointment.
He set to work like a cabinet-maker or an engraver, and appeared to
have no sympathy with the soul of the picture. On a Frenchman
(generally speaking), the distinction between the great and the little,
the exquisite and the indifferent, is in a great measure lost: his self-satisfied
egotism supplies whatever is wanting up to a certain point,
and neutralizes whatever goes beyond it. Another young man, at
the time I speak of, was for eleven weeks daily employed in making
a black-lead pencil drawing of a small Leonardo: he sat with his
legs balanced across a rail to do it, kept his hat on, every now and then
consulted with his friends about his progress, rose up, went to the fire
to warm himself, talked of the styles of the different masters—praising
Titian <em>pour les coloris</em>, Raphael <em>pour l’expression</em>, Poussin <em>pour la composition</em>—all
being alike to him, provided they had each something to
help him on in his harangue (for that was all he thought about),—and
then returned to <em>perfectionate</em> (as he called it) his copy. This would
drive an Englishman out of his senses, supposing him to be ever so
stupid. The perseverance and the interruptions, the labour without
impulse, the attention to the parts in succession, and disregard of the
whole together, are to him utterly incomprehensible. He wants to
do something striking, and bends all his thoughts and energies to one
mighty effort. A Frenchman has no notion of this summary
proceeding, exists mostly in his present sensations, and, if he is left
at liberty to enjoy or trifle with these, cares about nothing farther,
looking neither backwards nor forwards. They forgot the reign of
terror under Robespierre in a month; they forgot that they had ever
been called the <em>great nation</em> under Buonaparte in a week. They sat
in chairs on the Boulevards (just as they do at other times), when
the shots were firing into the next street, and were only persuaded to
quit them when their own soldiers were seen pouring down all the
avenues from the heights of Montmartre, crying ‘<em>Sauve qui peut!</em>’
They then went home and dressed themselves to see the <em>Allies</em> enter
Paris, as a fine sight, just as they would witness a procession at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>theatre. This is carrying the instinct of levity as far as it will go.
With all their affectation and want of sincerity, there is, on the
principle here stated, a kind of simplicity and nature about them after
all. They lend themselves to the impression of the moment with
good humour and good will, making it not much better nor worse
than it is: the English constantly over-do or under-do every thing,
and are either mad with enthusiasm or in despair. The extreme
slowness and regularity of the French school have then arisen, as a
natural consequence, out of their very fickleness and frivolity (their
severally supposed national characteristics); for, owing to the last,
their studious exactness costs them nothing; and, again, they have
no headstrong impulses or ardent longings that urge them on to the
violation of rules, or hurry them away with a subject or with the
interest belonging to it. All is foreseen and settled beforehand, so as
to assist the fluttering and feeble hold they have of things. When
they venture beyond the literal and formal, and (mistaking pedantry
and bombast for genius) attempt the grand and the impressive style,
as in David’s and Girodet’s pictures, the Lord deliver us from
sublimity engrafted on insipidity and <em>petit maître-ism</em>! You see a
solitary French artist in the Louvre copying a Raphael or a Rubens,
standing on one leg, not quite sure of what he is about: you see them
collected in groupes about David’s, elbowing each other, thinking
them even finer than Raphael, more truly themselves, a more perfect
combination of all that can be taught by the Greek sculptor and the
French posture-master! Is this patriotism, or want of taste? If the
former, it is excusable, and why not, if the latter?</p>

<p class='c007'>Even should a French artist fail, he is not disconcerted—there
is something else he excels in: ‘for one unkind and cruel fair,
another still consoles him.’ He studies in a more graceful posture,
or pays greater attention to his dress; or he has a friend, who has
<em>beaucoup du talent</em>, and conceit enough for them both. His self-love
has always a salvo, and comes upon its legs again, like a cat or
a monkey. Not so with Bruin the Bear. If an Englishman
(God help the mark!) fails in one thing, it is all over with him;
he is enraged at the mention of any thing else he can do, and at
every consolation offered him on that score; he banishes all other
thoughts, but of his disappointment and discomfiture, from his
breast—neither eats nor sleeps (it is well if he does not swallow
down double ‘potations, pottle-deep,’ to drown remembrance)—will
not own, even to himself, any other thing in which he takes an interest
or feels a pride; and is in the horrors till he recovers his good
opinion of himself in the only point on which he now sets a value,
and for which his anxiety and disorder of mind incapacitate him as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>effectually as if he were drunk with strong liquor instead of spleen
and passion. I have here drawn the character of an Englishman, I
am sure; for it is a portrait of myself, and, I am sorry to add, an
unexaggerated one. I intend these Essays as studies of human
nature; and as, in the prosecution of this design, I do not spare
others, I see no reason why I should spare myself. I lately tried to
make a copy of a portrait by Titian (after several years’ want of
practice), with a view to give a friend in England some notion of the
picture, which is equally remarkable and fine. I failed, and floundered
on for some days, as might be expected. I must say the effect on me
was painful and excessive. My sky was suddenly overcast. Every
thing seemed of the colour of the paints I used. Nature in my eyes
became dark and gloomy. I had no sense or feeling left, but of the
unforeseen want of power, and of the tormenting struggle to do what
I could not. I was ashamed ever to have written or spoken on art:
it seemed a piece of vanity and affectation in me to do so—all whose
reasonings and refinements on the subject ended in an execrable daub.
Why did I think of attempting such a thing without weighing the
consequences of exposing my presumption and incapacity so unnecessarily?
It was blotting from my mind, covering with a thick
veil all that I remembered of these pictures formerly—my hopes when
young, my regrets since, one of the few consolations of my life and
of my declining years. I was even afraid to walk out of an evening
by the barrier of Neuilly, or to recall the yearnings and associations
that once hung upon the beatings of my heart. All was turned to
bitterness and gall. To feel any thing but the consciousness of my
own helplessness and folly, appeared a want of sincerity, a mockery,
and an insult to my mortified pride! The only relief I had was in
the excess of pain I felt: this was at least some distinction. I was
not insensible on that side. No French artist, I thought, would
regret <em>not</em> copying a Titian so much as I did, nor so far shew the
same value for it, however he might have the advantage of me in
drawing or mechanical dexterity. Besides, I had copied this very
picture very well formerly. If ever I got out of my present scrape,
I had at any rate received a lesson not to run the same risk of vexation,
or commit myself gratuitously again upon any occasion whatever.
Oh! happy ought they to be, I said, who can do any thing, when I
feel the misery, the agony, the dull, gnawing pain of being unable to
do what I wish in this single instance! When I copied this picture
before, I had no other resource, no other language. My tongue
then stuck to the roof of my mouth: now it is unlocked, and I have
done what I then despaired of doing in another way. Ought I not
to be grateful and contented? Oh, yes!—and think how many there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>are who have nothing to which they can turn themselves, and fail in
every object they undertake. Well, then, <em>Let bygones be bygones</em> (as
the Scotch proverb has it); give up the attempt, and think no more
of Titian, or of the portrait of a Man in black in the Louvre. This
would be very well for any one else; but for me, who had nearly
exhausted the subject on paper, that I should take it into my head to
paint a libel of what I had composed so many and such fine panegyrics
upon—it was a fatality, a judgment upon me for my vapouring and
conceit. I must be as shy of the subject for the future as a damned
author is of the title of his play or the name of his hero ever after. Yet
the picture would look the same as ever. I could hardly bear to
think so: it would be hid or defaced to me as ‘in a phantasma or a
hideous dream.’ I must turn my thoughts from it, or they would
lead to madness! The copy went on better afterwards, and the affair
ended less tragically than I apprehended. I did not cut a hole in
the canvas, or commit any other extravagance: it is now hanging up
very quietly facing me; and I have considerable satisfaction in
occasionally looking at it, as I write this paragraph.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such are the agonies into which we throw ourselves about trifles—our
rage and disappointment at want of success in any favourite pursuit,
and, our neglect of the means to ensure it. A Frenchman, under the
penalty of half the chagrin at failure, would take just twice the pains
and consideration to avoid it: but our morbid eagerness and blundering
impetuosity, together with a certain <em>concreteness</em> of imagination which
prevents our dividing any operation into steps and stages, defeat the
very end we have in view. The worst of these wilful mischiefs of
our own making is, that they admit of no relief or intermission.
Natural calamities or great griefs, as we do not bring them upon
ourselves, so they find a seasonable respite in tears or resignation,
or in some alleviating contrast or reflection: but pride scorns all
alliance with natural frailty or indulgence; our wilful purposes regard
every relaxation or moment’s ease as a compromise of their very
essence, which consists in violence and effort: they turn away from
whatever might afford diversion or solace, and goad us on to exertions
as painful as they are unavailable, and with no other companion than
remorse,—the most intolerable of all inmates of the breast; for it is
constantly urging us to retrieve our peace of mind by an impossibility—the
undoing of what is past. One of the chief traits of sublimity in
Milton’s character of Satan is this dreadful display of unrelenting
pride and self-will—the sense of suffering joined with the sense of
power and ‘courage never to submit or yield’—and the aggravation
of the original purpose of lofty ambition and opposition to the
Almighty, with the total overthrow and signal punishment,—which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>ought to be reasons for its relinquishment. ‘His thoughts burn like
a hell within him!’ but he gives them ‘neither truce nor rest,’ and
will not even sue for mercy. This kind of sublimity must be thrown
away upon the French critic, who would only think Satan a very
ridiculous old gentleman for adhering so obstinately to his original
pretensions, and not making the most of circumstances, and giving in
his resignation to the ruling party! When Buonaparte fell, an
English editor (of virulent memory) exhausted a great number of the
finest passages in <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, in applying them to his ill-fated
ambition. This was an equal compliment to the poet and the conqueror:
to the last, for having realized a conception of himself in the
mind of his enemies on a par with the most stupendous creations of
imagination; to the first, for having embodied in fiction what bore so
strong a resemblance to, and was constantly brought to mind by, the
fearful and imposing reality! But to return to our subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the same with us in love and literature. An Englishman
makes love without thinking of the chances of success, his own disadvantages,
or the character of his mistress—that is, without the adaptation
of means to ends, consulting only his own humour or fancy;<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c008'><sup>[39]</sup></a> and
he writes a book of history or travels, without acquainting himself with
geography, or appealing to documents or dates; substituting his own will
or opinion in the room of these technical helps or hindrances, as he
considers them. It is not right. In business it is not by any means
the same; which looks as if, where interest was the moving principle,
and acted as a counterpoise to caprice and will, our headstrong propensity
gave way, though it sometimes leads us into extravagant and
ruinous speculations. Nor is it a disadvantage to us in war; for there
the spirit of contradiction does every thing, and an Englishman will
go to the devil sooner than yield to any odds. Courage is nothing
but will, defying consequences; and this the English have in perfection.

<p class='c013'>I apprehend, with his own countrymen or ours, all the love and
loyalty would come to little, but for their hatred of the army opposed
to them. It is the resistance, ‘the two to kill at a blow,’ that is the
charm, and makes our fingers’-ends tingle. The Greek cause makes
no progress with us for this reason: it is one of pure sympathy, but
our sympathies must arise out of our antipathies; they were devoted
to the Queen to spite the King. We had a wonderful affection for
the Spaniards—the secret of which was that we detested the French.
Our love must begin with hate. It is so far well that the French are
opposed to us in almost every way; for the spirit of contradiction
alone to foreign fopperies and absurdities keeps us within some bounds
of decency and order. When an English lady of quality introduces
a favourite by saying, ‘This is his lordship’s physician, and my
atheist,’ the humour might become epidemic; but we can stop it at
once by saying, ‘That is so like a Frenchwoman!’—The English
excel in the practical and mechanic arts, where mere plodding and
industry are expected and required; but they do not combine
business and pleasure well together. Thus, in the Fine Arts, which
unite the mechanical with the sentimental, they will probably never
succeed; for the one spoils and diverts them from the other. An
Englishman can attend but to one thing at a time. He hates music
at dinner. He can go through any labour or pain with prodigious
fortitude; but he cannot make a pleasure of it, or persuade himself
he is doing a <em>fine thing</em>, when he is not. Again, they are great in
original discoveries, which come upon them by surprise, and which
they leave to others to perfect. It is a question whether, if they
foresaw they were about to make the discovery, at the very point of
projection as it were, they would not turn their backs upon it, and
leave it to shift for itself; or obstinately refuse to take the last step,
or give up the pursuit, in mere dread and nervous apprehension lest
they should not succeed. Poetry is also their undeniable element;
for the essence of poetry is will and passion, ‘and it alone is highly
fantastical.’ French poetry is <em>verbiage</em> or dry detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have thus endeavoured to shew why it is the English fail as a people
in the Fine Arts, because the idea of the end absorbs that of the
means. Hogarth was an exception to this rule; but then every stroke
of his pencil was instinct with genius. As it has been well said, that
‘we <em>read</em> his works,’ so it might be said he <em>wrote</em> them. Barry is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>instance more to my purpose. No one could argue better about <em>gusto</em>
in painting, and yet no one ever painted with less. His pictures
were dry, coarse, and wanted all that his descriptions of those of
others indicate. For example, he speaks of ‘the dull, dead, watery
look’ of the Medusa’s head of Leonardo, in a manner that conveys
an absolute idea of the character: had he copied it, you would never
have suspected any thing of the kind. His pen grows almost wanton
in praise of Titian’s nymph-like figures. What <em>drabs</em> he has made
of his own sea-nymphs, floating in the Thames, with Dr. Burney at
their head, with his wig on! He is like a person admiring the grace
of an accomplished rope-dancer; place him on the rope himself, and
his head turns;—or he is like Luther’s comparison of Reason to a
drunken man on horseback—‘set him up on one side, and he tumbles
over on the other.’ Why is this? His mind was essentially ardent
and discursive, not sensitive or observant; and though the immediate
object acted as a stimulus to his imagination, it was only as it does to
the poet’s—that is, as a link in the chain of association, as implying
other strong feelings and ideas, and not for its intrinsic beauty or
individual details. He had not the painter’s eye, though he had the
painter’s general knowledge. There is as great a difference in this
respect between our views of things as between the telescope and microscope.
People in general see objects only to distinguish them in practice
and by name—to know that a hat is black, that a chair is not a table,
that John is not James; and there are painters, particularly of history
in England, who look very little farther. They cannot finish any
thing, or go over a head twice: the first <em>coup-d’œil</em> is all they ever
arrive at, nor can they refine on their impressions, soften them down,
or reduce them to their component parts, without losing their spirit.
The inevitable result of this is grossness, and also want of force and
solidity; for, in reality, the parts cannot be separated without injury
from the whole. Such people have no pleasure in the art as such: it
is merely to astonish or to thrive that they follow it; or, if thrown
out of it by accident, they regret it only as a bankrupt tradesman does
a business which was a handsome subsistence to him. Barry did not
live, like Titian, on the taste of colours (there was here, perhaps—and
I will not disguise it—in English painters in general, a defect of
organic susceptibility); they were not a <em>pabulum</em> to his senses; he did
not hold green, blue, red, and yellow for ‘the darlings of his precious
eye.’ They did not, therefore, sink into his mind with all their
hidden harmonies, nor nourish and enrich it with material beauty,
though he knew enough of them to furnish hints for other ideas and
to suggest topics of discourse. If he had had the most enchanting
object in nature before him in his painting-room at the Adelphi, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>would have turned from it, after a moment’s burst of admiration, to
talk of the subject of his next composition, and to scrawl in some new
and vast design, illustrating a series of great events in history, or
some vague moral theory. The art itself was nothing to him, though
he made it the stalking-horse to his ambition and display of intellectual
power in general; and, therefore, he neglected its essential
qualities to daub in huge allegories, or carry on cabals with the
Academy, in which the violence of his will and the extent of his
views found proper food and scope. As a painter, he was tolerable
merely as a draftsman, or in that part of the art which may be best
reduced to rules and precepts, or to positive measurements. There
is neither colouring, nor expression, nor delicacy, nor striking effect
in his pictures at the Adelphi. The group of youths and horses, in
the representation of the Olympic Games, is the best part of them,
and has more of the grace and spirit of a Greek bas-relief than any
thing of the same kind in the French school of painting. Barry was,
all his life, a thorn in the side of Sir Joshua, who was irritated by the
temper and disconcerted by the powers of the man; and who, conscious
of his own superiority in the exercise of his profession, yet looked
askance at Barry’s loftier pretensions and more gigantic scale of art.
But he had no more occasion to be really jealous of him than of an
Irish porter or orator. It was like Imogen’s mistaking the dead body
of Cloten for her lord’s—‘the jovial thigh, the brawns of Hercules’:
the head, which would have detected the cheat, was missing!</p>

<p class='c007'>I might have gone more into the subject of our apparent indifference
to the pleasure of mere imitation, if I had had to run a
parallel between English and Italian or even Flemish art; but really,
though I find a great deal of what is finical, I find nothing of the
pleasurable in the details of French more than of English art. The
English artist, it is an old and just complaint, can with difficulty be
prevailed upon to finish any part of a picture but the face, even if he
does that any tolerable justice: the French artist bestows equal and
elaborate pains on every part of his picture—the dress, the carpet,
&#38;c.; and it has been objected to the latter method, that it has the
effect of making the face look unfinished; for as this is variable and
in motion, it can never admit of the same minuteness of imitation as
objects of <em>still-life</em>, and must suffer in the comparison, if these have
the utmost possible degree of attention bestowed on them, and do not
fall into their relative place in the composition from their natural
insignificance. But does not this distinction shew generally that the
English have no pleasure in art, unless there is an additional interest
beyond what is borrowed from the eye, and that the French have the
same pleasure in it, provided the mechanical operation is the same—like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>fly that settles equally on the face or dress, and runs over the
whole surface with the same lightness and indifference? The collar
of a coat is out of drawing: this may be and is wrong. But I cannot
say that it gives me the same disturbance as if the nose was awry.
A Frenchman thinks that both are equally out of drawing, and sets
about correcting them both with equal gravity and perseverance. A
part of the back-ground of a picture is left in an unfinished state: this
is a sad eye-sore to the French artist or connoisseur. We English
care little about it: if the head and character are well given, we pass
it over as of small consequence; and if they are failures, it is of even
less. A French painter, after having made you look like a baboon,
would go on finishing the cravat or the buttons of your coat with all
the nicety of a man milliner or button-maker, and the most perfect
satisfaction with himself and his art. This with us would be quite
impossible. ‘They are careful after many things: with us, there is
one thing needful’—which is effect. We certainly throw our impressions
more into masses (they are not taken off by pattern, every
part alike): there may be a slowness and repugnance at first; but,
afterwards, there is an impulse, a <em>momentum</em> acquired—one interest
absorbing and being strengthened by several others; and if we gain
our principal object, we can overlook the rest, or at least cannot find
time to attend to them till we have secured this. We have nothing
of the <em>petit maître</em>, of the <em>martinet</em> style about us: we run into the
opposite fault. If we had time, if we had power, there could be no
objection to giving every part with the utmost perfection, as it is given
in a looking-glass. But if we have only a month to do a portrait in,
is it not better to give three weeks to the face and one to the dress,
than one week to the face and three to the dress. How often do
we look at the face compared to the dress? ‘On a good foundation,’
says Sancho Panza, ‘a good house may be built’; so a good picture
should have a good back-ground, and be finished in every part. It is
entitled to this mark of respect, which is like providing a frame for
it, and hanging it in a good light. I can easily understand how
Rubens or Vandyke finished the back grounds and drapery of their
pictures:—they were worth the trouble; and, besides, it cost them
nothing. It was to them no more than blowing a bubble in the air.
One would no doubt have every thing right—a feather in a cap, or a
plant in the foreground—if a thought or a touch would do it. But
to labour on for ever, and labour to no purpose, is beyond mortal or
English patience. Our clumsiness is one cause of our negligence.
Depend upon it, people do with readiness what they can do well. I
rather wonder, therefore, that Raphael took such pains in finishing
his draperies and back grounds, which he did so indifferently. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>expression is like an emanation of the soul, or like a lamp shining
within and illuminating the whole face and body; and every part,
charged with so sacred a trust as the conveying of this expression
(even to the hands and feet), would be wrought up to the highest
perfection. But his inanimate objects must have cost him some
trouble; and yet he laboured them too. In what he could not do
well, he was still determined to do his best; and that nothing should
be wanting in decorum and respect to an art that he had consecrated
to virtue, and to that genius that burnt like a flame upon its altars!
We have nothing that for myself I can compare with this high and
heroic pursuit of art for its own sake. The French fancy their own
pedantic abortions equal to it, thrust them into the Louvre, ‘and with
their darkness dare affront that light!’—thus proving themselves
without the germ or the possibility of excellence—the feeling of it in
others. We at least claim some interest in art, by looking up to its
loftiest monuments—retire to a distance, and reverence the sanctuary,
if we cannot enter it.</p>

<p class='c013'>but we would still be our selves, to possess and enjoy all these, or we
would not give a doit for them. But, on this supposition, what in truth
should we be the better for them? It is not we, but another, that
would reap the benefit; and what do we care about that other? In that
case, the present owner might as well continue to enjoy them. <em>We</em>
should not be gainers by the change. If the meanest beggar who crouches
at a palace-gate, and looks up with awe and suppliant fear to the proud
inmate as he passes, could be put in possession of all the finery, the pomp,
the luxury, and wealth that he sees and envies on the sole condition
of getting rid, together with his rags and misery, of all recollection that
there ever was such a wretch as himself, he would reject the proffered
boon with scorn. He might be glad to change situations; but he would
insist on keeping his own thoughts, to <em>compare notes</em>, and point the transition
by the force of contrast. He would not, on any account, forego his
self-congratulation on the unexpected accession of good fortune, and his
escape from past suffering. All that excites his cupidity, his envy, his
repining or despair, is the alternative of some great good to himself; and
if, in order to attain that object, he is to part with his own existence to
take that of another, he can feel no farther interest in it. This is the
language both of passion and reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here lies ‘the rub that makes calamity of so long life:’ for it is
not barely the apprehension of the ills that ‘in that sleep of death may
come,’ but also our ignorance and indifference to the promised good,
that produces our repugnance and backwardness to quit the present
scene. No man, if he had his choice, would be the angel Gabriel
to-morrow! What is the angel Gabriel to him but a splendid
vision? He might as well have an ambition to be turned into a
bright cloud, or a particular star. The interpretation of which is, he can
have no sympathy with the angel Gabriel. Before he can be transformed
into so bright and ethereal an essence, he must necessarily ‘put
off this mortal coil’—be divested of all his old habits, passions, thoughts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>and feelings—to be endowed with other lofty and beatific attributes,
of which he has no notion; and, therefore, he would rather remain a
little longer in this mansion of clay, which, with all its flaws, inconveniences,
and perplexities, contains all that he has any real knowledge
of, or any affection for. When, indeed, he is about to quit it in spite
of himself, and has no other chance left to escape the darkness of the
tomb, he may then have no objection (making a virtue of necessity)
to put on angels’ wings, to have radiant locks, to wear a wreath of
amaranth, and thus to masquerade it in the skies.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is an instance of the truth and beauty of the ancient mythology,
that the various transmutations it recounts are never voluntary, or of
favourable omen, but are interposed as a timely release to those who,
driven on by fate, and urged to the last extremity of fear or anguish, are
turned into a flower, a plant, an animal, a star, a precious stone, or
into some object that may inspire pity or mitigate our regret for their
misfortunes. Narcissus was transformed into a flower; Daphne into
a laurel; Arethusa into a fountain (by the favour of the gods)—but
not till no other remedy was left for their despair. It is a sort of
smiling cheat upon death, and graceful compromise with annihilation.
It is better to exist by proxy, in some softened type and soothing
allegory, than not at all—to breathe in a flower or shine in a constellation,
than to be utterly forgot; but no one would change his natural
condition (if he could help it) for that of a bird, an insect, a beast,
or a fish, however delightful their mode of existence, or however
enviable he might deem their lot compared to his own. Their
thoughts are not our thoughts—their happiness is not our happiness;
nor can we enter into it except with a passing smile of approbation,
or as a refinement of fancy. As the poet sings:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What more felicity can fall to creature</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Than to enjoy delight with liberty,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to be lord of all the works of nature?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To reign in the air from earth to highest sky;</div>
      <div class='line'>To feed on flowers and weeds of glorious feature;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To taste whatever thing doth please the eye?—</div>
      <div class='line'>Who rests not pleased with such happiness,</div>
      <div class='line'>Well worthy he to taste of wretchedness!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This is gorgeous description and fine declamation: yet who would be
found to act upon it, even in the forming of a wish; or would not
rather be the thrall of wretchedness, than launch out (by the aid of
some magic spell) into all the delights of such a butterfly state of
existence? The French (if any people can) may be said to enjoy
this airy, heedless gaiety and unalloyed exuberance of satisfaction: yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>what Englishman would deliberately change with them? We
would sooner be miserable after our own fashion than happy after
their’s. It is not happiness, then, in the abstract, which we seek, that
can be addressed as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That something still that prompts th’ eternal sigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>For which we wish to live or dare to die,—’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>but a happiness suited to our taste and faculties—that has become a
part of ourselves, by habit and enjoyment—that is endeared to us by
a thousand recollections, privations, and sufferings. No one, then,
would willingly change his country or his kind for the most plausible
pretences held out to him. The most humiliating punishment
inflicted in ancient fable is the change of sex: not that it was any
degradation in itself—but that it must occasion a total derangement
of the moral economy and confusion of the sense of personal propriety.
The thing is said to have happened, <em>au sens contraire</em>, in our time.
The story is to be met with in ‘very choice Italian’; and Lord D——
tells it in very plain English!</p>

<p class='c007'>We may often find ourselves envying the possessions of others, and
sometimes inadvertently indulging a wish to change places with them
altogether; but our self-love soon discovers some excuse to be off the
bargain we were ready to strike, and retracts ‘vows made in haste,
as violent and void.’ We might make up our minds to the alteration
in every other particular; but, when it comes to the point, there is sure to
be some trait or feature of character in the object of our admiration
to which we cannot reconcile ourselves—some favourite quality or
darling foible of our own, with which we can by no means resolve to
part. The more enviable the situation of another, the more entirely
to our taste, the more reluctant we are to leave any part of ourselves
behind that would be so fully capable of appreciating all the exquisiteness
of its new situation, or not to enter into the possession of such an
imaginary reversion of good fortune with all our previous inclinations
and sentiments. The outward circumstances were fine: they only
wanted a <em>soul</em> to enjoy them, and that soul is our’s (as the costly
ring wants the peerless jewel to perfect and set it off). The humble
prayer and petition to sneak into visionary felicity by personal
adoption, or the surrender of our own personal pretensions, always
ends in a daring project of usurpation, and a determination to expel
the actual proprietor, and supply his place so much more worthily
with our own identity—not bating a single jot of it. Thus, in passing
through a fine collection of pictures, who has not envied the
privilege of visiting it every day, and wished to be the owner?
But the rising sigh is soon checked, and ‘the native hue of emulation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,’ when we come to ask
ourselves not merely whether the owner has any taste at all for these
splendid works, and does not look upon them as so much expensive
furniture, like his chairs and tables—but whether he has the same
precise (and only true) taste that we have—whether he has the very
same favourites that we have—whether he may not be so blind as to
prefer a Vandyke to a Titian, a Ruysdael to a Claude;—nay,
whether he may not have other pursuits and avocations that draw off
his attention from the sole objects of our idolatry, and which seem to
us mere impertinences and waste of time? In that case, we at once lose
all patience, and exclaim indignantly, ‘Give us back our taste and
keep your pictures!’ It is not we who should envy them the possession
of the treasure, but they who should envy us the true and exclusive
enjoyment of it. A similar train of feeling seems to have dictated
Warton’s spirited Sonnet on visiting Wilton-House:—</p>

<p class='c013'>One sometimes passes by a gentleman’s park, an old family-seat, with
its moss-grown ruinous paling, its ‘glades mild-opening to the genial
day,’ or embrowned with forest-trees. Here one would be glad to
spend one’s life, ‘shut up in measureless content,’ and to grow old
beneath ancestral oaks, instead of gaining a precarious, irksome, and
despised livelihood, by indulging romantic sentiments, and writing
disjointed descriptions of them. The thought has scarcely risen to
the lips, when we learn that the owner of so blissful a seclusion is a
thorough-bred fox-hunter, a preserver of the game, a brawling
electioneerer, a Tory member of parliament, a ‘no-Popery’ man!—‘I’d
sooner be a dog, and bay the moon!’ Who would be Sir
Thomas Lethbridge for his title and estate? asks one man. But
would not almost any one wish to be Sir Francis Burdett, the man of
the people, the idol of the electors of Westminster? says another. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>can only answer for myself. Respectable and honest as he is, there is
something in his white boots, and white breeches, and white coat, and
white hair, and red face, and white hat, that I cannot, by any effort
of candour, confound my personal identity with! If Mr. Hobhouse
can prevail on Sir Francis to exchange, let him do so by all means.
Perhaps they might contrive to <em>club</em> a soul between them! Could I
have had my will, I should have been born a lord: but one would not
be a booby lord neither. I am haunted by an odd fancy of driving
down the Great North Road in a chaise and four, about fifty years ago,
and coming to the inn at Ferry-bridge, with out-riders, white favours,
and a coronet on the panels; and then I choose my companion in the
coach. Really there is a witchcraft in all this that makes it necessary
to turn away from it, lest, in the conflict between imagination and
impossibility, I should grow feverish and light-headed! But, on the
other hand, if one was born a lord, should one have the same idea
(that every one else has) of <em>a peeress in her own right</em>? Is not
distance, giddy elevation, mysterious awe, an impassable gulf, necessary
to form this idea in the mind, that fine ligament of ‘ethereal braid,
sky-woven,’ that lets down heaven upon earth, fair as enchantment,
soft as Berenice’s hair, bright and garlanded like Ariadne’s crown;
and is it not better to have had this idea all through life—to have
caught but glimpses of it, to have known it but in a dream—than to
have been born a lord ten times over, with twenty pampered menials at
one’s back, and twenty descents to boast of? It is the envy of certain
privileges, the sharp privations we have undergone, the cutting
neglect we have met with from the want of birth or title, that gives its
zest to the distinction: the thing itself may be indifferent or contemptible
enough. It is the <em>becoming</em> a lord that is to be desired; but he who
becomes a lord in reality is an upstart—a mere pretender, without
the sterling essence; so that, all that is of any worth in this supposed
transition is purely imaginary and impossible. Had I been a lord, I
should have married Miss ——, and my life would not have been one
long-drawn sigh, made up of sweet and bitter regret!<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c008'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Had I been
a lord, I would have been a Popish lord, and then I might also have
been an honest man:—poor, and then I might have been proud and
not vulgar! Kings are so accustomed to look down on all the rest of
the world, that they consider the condition of mortality as vile and
intolerable, if stripped of royal state, and cry out in the bitterness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of their despair, ‘Give me a crown, or a tomb!’ It should seem from this
as if all mankind would change with the first crowned head that could
propose the alternative, or that it would be only the presumption of the
supposition, or a sense of their own unworthiness, that would deter
them. Perhaps there is not a single throne that, if it was to be filled
by this sort of voluntary metempsychosis, would not remain empty.
Many would, no doubt, be glad to ‘monarchise, be feared, and kill
with looks’ in their own persons and after their own fashion: but who
would be the <em>double</em> of ——, or of those shadows of a shade—those
‘tenth transmitters of a foolish face’—Charles <span class='fss'>X.</span> and Ferdinand
<span class='fss'>VII.</span>? If monarchs have little sympathy with mankind, mankind
have even less with monarchs. They are merely to us a sort of state-puppets
or royal wax-work, which we may gaze at with superstitious
wonder, but have no wish to become; and he who should meditate such
a change must not only feel by anticipation an utter contempt for the
<em>slough</em> of humanity which he is prepared to cast, but must feel an
absolute void and want of attraction in those lofty and incomprehensible
sentiments which are to supply its place. With respect to actual
royalty, the spell is in a great measure broken. But, among ancient
monarchs, there is no one, I think, who envies Darius or Xerxes.
One has a different feeling with respect to Alexander or Pyrrhus;
but this is because they were great men as well as great kings, and
the soul is up in arms at the mention of their names as at the sound
of a trumpet. But as to all the rest—those ‘in the catalogue who go
for kings’—the praying, eating, drinking, dressing monarchs of the
earth, in time past or present—one would as soon think of wishing to
personate the Golden Calf, or to turn out with Nebuchadnezzar to
graze, as to be transformed into one of that ‘swinish multitude.’
There is no point of affinity. The extrinsic circumstances are
imposing: but, within, there is nothing but morbid humours and
proud flesh! Some persons might vote for Charlemagne; and there
are others who would have no objection to be the modern Charlemagne,
with all he inflicted and suffered, even after the necromantic field of
Waterloo, and the bloody wreath on the vacant brow of his conqueror,
and that fell jailer set over him by a craven foe, that ‘glared round his
soul, and mocked his closing eyelids!’</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been remarked, that could we at pleasure change our
situation in life, more persons would be found anxious to descend than
to ascend in the scale of society. One reason may be, that we have it
more in our power to do so; and this encourages the thought, and
makes it familiar to us. A second is, that we naturally wish to
throw off the cares of state, of fortune or business, that oppress us, and
to seek repose before we find it in the grave. A third reason is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>that, as we descend to common life, the pleasures are simple, natural,
such as all can enter into, and therefore excite a general interest,
and combine all suffrages. Of the different occupations of life, none
is beheld with a more pleasing emotion, or less aversion to a change of
our own, than that of a shepherd tending his flock: the pastoral ages
have been the envy and the theme of all succeeding ones; and a
beggar with his crutch is more closely allied than the monarch and
his crown to the associations of mirth and heart’s ease. On the other
hand, it must be admitted that our pride is too apt to prefer grandeur
to happiness; and that our passions make us envy great vices oftener
than great virtues.</p>

<p class='c007'>The world shew their sense in nothing more than in a distrust and
aversion to those changes of situation which only tend to make the
successful candidates ridiculous, and which do not carry along with
them a mind adequate to the circumstances. The common people, in
this respect, are more shrewd and judicious than their superiors, from
feeling their own awkwardness and incapacity, and often decline, with
an instinctive modesty, the troublesome honours intended for them.
They do not overlook their original defects so readily as others overlook
their acquired advantages. It is wonderful, therefore, that
opera-singers and dancers refuse, or only <em>condescend</em> as it were, to
accept lords, though the latter are so often fascinated by them. The
fair performer knows (better than her unsuspecting admirer) how
little connection there is between the dazzling figure she makes on the
stage and that which she may make in private life, and is in no hurry
to convert ‘the drawing-room into a Green-room.’ The nobleman
(supposing him not to be very wise) is astonished at the miraculous
powers of art in</p>

<p class='c007'>and thinks such a paragon must easily conform to the routine of
manners and society which every trifling woman of quality of his
acquaintance, from sixteen to sixty, goes through without effort.
This is a hasty or a wilful conclusion. Things of habit only come
by habit, and inspiration here avails nothing. A man of fortune who
marries an actress for her fine performance of tragedy, has been
well compared to the person who bought Punch. The lady is not
unfrequently aware of the inconsequentiality, and unwilling to be put
on the shelf, and hid in the nursery of some musty country-mansion.
Servant girls, of any sense and spirit, treat their masters (who make
serious love to them) with suitable contempt. What is it but a
proposal to drag an unmeaning trollop at his heels through life, to
her own annoyance and the ridicule of all his friends? No woman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>I suspect, ever forgave a man who raised her from a low condition
in life (it is a perpetual obligation and reproach); though, I believe,
men often feel the most disinterested regard for women under such
circumstances. Sancho Panza discovered no less folly in his eagerness
to enter upon his new government, than wisdom in quitting it as
fast as possible. Why will Mr. Cobbett persist in getting into
Parliament? He would find himself no longer the same man.
What member of Parliament, I should like to know, could write his
Register? As a popular partisan, he may (for aught I can say) be
a match for the whole Honourable House; but, by obtaining a seat
in St. Stephen’s Chapel, he would only be equal to a 576th part of
it. It was surely a puerile ambition in Mr. Addington to succeed
Mr. Pitt as prime-minister. The situation was only a foil to his
imbecility. Gipsies have a fine faculty of evasion: catch them who
can in the same place or story twice! Take them; teach them the
comforts of civilization; confine them in warm rooms, with thick
carpets and down beds; and they will fly out of the window-like
the bird, described by Chaucer, out of its golden cage. I maintain
that there is no common language or medium of understanding
between people of education and without it—between those who
judge of things from books or from their senses. Ignorance has so
far the advantage over learning; for it can make an appeal to you
from what you know; but you cannot re-act upon it through that
which it is a perfect stranger to. Ignorance is, therefore, power.
This is what foiled Buonaparte in Spain and Russia. The people
can only be gained over by informing them, though they may be
enslaved by fraud or force. You say there is a common language in
nature. They see nature through their wants, while you look at it
for your pleasure. Ask a country lad if he does not like to hear the
birds sing in the spring? And he will laugh in your face. ‘What
is it, then, he does like?’—‘Good victuals and drink!’ As if you
had not these too; but because he has them not, he thinks of nothing
else, and laughs at you and your refinements, supposing you to live
upon air. To those who are deprived of every other advantage,
even nature is a <em>book sealed</em>. I have made this capital mistake all my
life, in imagining that those objects which lay open to all, and excited
an interest merely from the <em>idea</em> of them, spoke a common language
to all; and that nature was a kind of universal home, where all ages,
sexes, classes met. Not so. The vital air, the sky, the woods,
the streams—all these go for nothing, except with a favoured few.
The poor are taken up with their bodily wants—the rich, with
external acquisitions: the one, with the sense of property—the other,
of its privation. Both have the same distaste for <em>sentiment</em>. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span><em>genteel</em> are the slaves of appearances—the vulgar, of necessity; and
neither has the smallest regard to true worth, refinement, generosity.
All savages are irreclaimable. I can understand the Irish character
better than the Scotch. I hate the formal crust of circumstances
and the mechanism of society. I have been recommended, indeed,
to settle down into some respectable profession for life:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>‘Ah! why so soon the blossom tear?’</div>

<p class='c013'>I am ‘in no haste to be venerable!’</p>

<p class='c007'>In thinking of those one might wish to have been, many people
will exclaim, ‘Surely, you would like to have been Shakspeare?’
Would Garrick have consented to the change? No, nor should he;
for the applause which he received, and on which he lived, was more
adapted to his genius and taste. If Garrick had agreed to be
Shakspeare, he would have made it a previous condition that he
was to be a better player. He would have insisted on taking some
higher part than <em>Polonius</em> or the <em>Grave-digger</em>. Ben Jonson and his
companions at the Mermaid would not have known their old friend
Will in his new disguise. The modern Roscius would have scouted
the halting player. He would have shrunk from the parts of the
inspired poet. If others were unlike us, we feel it as a presumption
and an impertinence to usurp their place; if they were like us, it seems
a work of supererogation. We are not to be cozened out of our
existence for nothing. It has been ingeniously urged, as an objection
to having been Milton, that ‘then we should not have had the
pleasure of reading Paradise Lost.’ Perhaps I should incline to
draw lots with Pope, but that he was deformed, and did not
sufficiently relish Milton and Shakspeare. As it is, we can enjoy
his verses and their’s too. Why, having these, need we ever be
dissatisfied with ourselves? Goldsmith is a person whom I considerably
affect, notwithstanding his blunders and his misfortunes. The
author of the <em>Vicar of Wakefield</em>, and of <em>Retaliation</em>, is one whose
temper must have had something eminently amiable, delightful, gay,
and happy in it.</p>

<p class='c013'>But then I could never make up my mind to his preferring Rowe
and Dryden to the worthies of the Elizabethan age; nor could I, in
like manner, forgive Sir Joshua—whom I number among those
whose existence was marked with a <em>white stone</em>, and on whose tomb
might be inscribed ‘Thrice Fortunate!’—his treating Nicholas
Poussin with contempt. Differences in matters of taste and opinion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>are points of honour—‘stuff o’ the conscience’—stumbling-blocks
not to be got over. Others, we easily grant, may have more wit,
learning, imagination, riches, strength, beauty, which we should be
glad to borrow of them; but that they have sounder or better views
of things, or that we should act wisely in changing in this respect, is
what we can by no means persuade ourselves. We may not be the
lucky possessors of what is best or most desirable; but our notion of
what is best and most desirable we will give up to no man by choice
or compulsion; and unless others (the greatest wits or brightest
geniuses) can come into our way of thinking, we must humbly beg
leave to remain as we are. A Calvinistic preacher would not
relinquish a single point of faith to be the Pope of Rome; nor
would a strict Unitarian acknowledge the mystery of the Holy
Trinity to have painted Raphael’s <em>Assembly of the Just</em>. In the
range of <em>ideal</em> excellence, we are distracted by variety and repelled by
differences: the imagination is fickle and fastidious, and requires a
combination of all possible qualifications, which never met. Habit
alone is blind and tenacious of the most homely advantages; and after
running the tempting round of nature, fame, and fortune, we wrap
ourselves up in our familiar recollections and humble pretensions—as
the lark, after long fluttering on sunny wing, sinks into its lowly
bed!</p>

<p class='c007'>We can have no very importunate craving, nor very great confidence,
in wishing to change characters, except with those with
whom we are intimately acquainted by their works; and having
these by us (which is all we know or covet in them), what would
we have more? We can have <em>no more of a cat than her skin</em>; nor
of an author than his brains. By becoming Shakspeare in reality,
we cut ourselves out of reading Milton, Pope, Dryden, and a
thousand more—all of whom we have in our possession, enjoy, and
<em>are</em>, by turns, in the best part of them, their thoughts, without any
metamorphosis or miracle at all. What a microcosm is our’s! What
a Proteus is the human mind! All that we know, think of, or can
admire, in a manner becomes ourselves. We are not (the meanest
of us) a volume, but a whole library! In this calculation of problematical
contingencies, the lapse of time makes no difference. One
would as soon have been Raphael as any modern artist. Twenty,
thirty, or forty years of elegant enjoyment and lofty feeling were as
great a luxury in the fifteenth as in the nineteenth century. But
Raphael did not live to see Claude, nor Titian Rembrandt. Those
who found arts and sciences are not witnesses of their accumulated
results and benefits; nor in general do they reap the meed of praise
which is their due. We who come after in some ‘laggard age,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>have more enjoyment of their fame than they had. Who would
have missed the sight of the Louvre in all its glory to have been one
of those whose works enriched it? Would it not have been giving
a certain good for an uncertain advantage? No: I am as sure (if it
is not presumption to say so) of what passed through Raphael’s mind
as of what passes through my own; and I know the difference
between seeing (though even that is a rare privilege) and producing
such perfection. At one time I was so devoted to Rembrandt, that
I think, if the Prince of Darkness had made me the offer in some
rash mood, I should have been tempted to close with it, and should
have become (in happy hour, and in downright earnest) the great
master of light and shade!</p>

<p class='c007'>I have run myself out of my materials for this Essay, and want
a well-turned sentence or two to conclude with; like Benvenuto
Cellini, who complains that, with all the brass, tin, iron, and lead he
could muster in the house, his statue of Perseus was left imperfect,
with a dent in the heel of it. Once more then—I believe there is
one character that all the world would be glad to change with—which
is that of a favoured rival. Even hatred gives way to envy.
We would be any thing—a toad in a dungeon—to live upon her
smile, which is our all of earthly hope and happiness; nor can we, in
our infatuation, conceive that there is any difference of feeling on
the subject, or that the pressure of her hand is not in itself divine,
making those to whom such bliss is deigned like the Immortal Gods!</p>

<p class='c017'>Servility is a sort of bastard envy. We heap our whole stock of
involuntary adulation on a single prominent figure, to have an excuse
for withdrawing our notice from all other claims (perhaps juster and
more galling ones), and in the hope of sharing a part of the applause
as train-bearers.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>II</h3>

<p class='c017'>Admiration is catching by a certain sympathy. The vain admire
the vain; the morose are pleased with the morose; nay, the selfish
and cunning are charmed with the tricks and meanness of which they
are witnesses, and may be in turn the dupes.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Vanity is no proof of conceit. A vain man often accepts of praise
as a cheap substitute for his own good opinion. He may think more
highly of another, though he would be wounded to the quick if his
own circle thought so. He knows the worthlessness and hollowness
of the flattery to which he is accustomed, but his ear is tickled with
the sound; and the effeminate in this way can no more live without
the incense of applause, than the effeminate in another can live without
perfumes or any other customary indulgence of the senses. Such
people would rather have the applause of fools than the approbation of
the wise. It is a low and shallow ambition.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>IV</h3>

<p class='c017'>It was said of some one who had contrived to make himself
popular abroad by getting into <em>hot water</em>, but who proved very
troublesome and ungrateful when he came home—‘We thought him
a very persecuted man in India’—the proper answer to which is, that
there are some people who are good for nothing else but to be
persecuted. They want some check to keep them in order.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>V</h3>

<p class='c017'>It is a sort of gratuitous error in high life, that the poor are
naturally thieves and beggars, just as the latter conceive that the rich
are naturally proud and hard-hearted. Give a man who is starving
a thousand a-year, and he will be no longer under a temptation to get
himself hanged by stealing a leg of mutton for his dinner; he may
still spend it in gaming, drinking, and the other vices of a gentleman,
and not in <em>charity</em>, about which he before made such an outcry.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>VI</h3>

<p class='c017'>Do not confer benefits in the expectation of meeting with gratitude;
and do not cease to confer them because you find those whom you
have served ungrateful. Do what you think fit and right to please
yourself; the generosity is not the less real, because it does not meet
with a correspondent return. A man should study to get through the
world as he gets through St. Giles’s—with as little annoyance and
interruption as possible from the shabbiness around him.</p>

<p class='c017'><em>Common-place</em> advisers and men of the world, are always pestering
you to conform to their maxims and modes, just like the <em>barkers</em> in

in and <em>refit</em> at their second-hand repositories.</p>

<p class='c017'>The word <em>gentility</em> is constantly in the mouths of vulgar people; as
quacks and pretenders are always talking of <em>genius</em>. Those who
possess any real excellence think and say the least about it.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>IX</h3>

<p class='c017'>Taste is often envy in disguise: it turns into the art of reducing
excellence within the smallest possible compass, or of finding out the
<em>minimum</em> of pleasure. Some people admire only what is new and
fashionable—the work of the day, of some popular author—the last
and frothiest bubble that glitters on the surface of fashion. All the
rest is gone by, ‘in the deep bosom of the ocean buried;’ to allude
to it is Gothic, to insist upon it odious. We have only to wait a
week to be relieved of the hot-pressed page, of the vignette-title; and
in the interim can look with sovereign contempt on the wide range of
science, learning, art, and on those musty old writers who lived before
the present age of novels. Peace be with their <em>manes</em>! There are
others, on the contrary, to whom all the modern publications are
anathema, a by-word—they get rid of this idle literature ‘at one fell
swoop’—disqualify the present race from all pretensions whatever,
get into a corner with an obscure writer, and devour the cobwebs
and the page together, and pick out in the quaintest production, the
quaintest passages, the merest <em>choke-pear</em>, which they think nobody
can swallow but themselves.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>X</h3>

<p class='c017'>The source of the love of nature or of the country has never been
explained so well as it might. The truth is this. Natural or
inanimate objects please merely as objects of sense or contemplation,
and we ask no return of the passion or admiration from them, so that
we cannot be disappointed or distracted in our choice. If we are
delighted with a flower or a tree, we are pleased with it <em>for its own
sake</em>; nothing more is required to make our satisfaction complete;
we do not ask the flower or tree whether it likes us again; and,
therefore, wherever we can meet with the same or a similar object,
we may reckon upon a recurrence of the same soothing emotion.
Nature is the only mistress that smiles on us still the same; and does
not repay admiration with scorn, love with hatred. She is faithful to
us, as long as we are faithful to ourselves. Whereas, in regard to the
human species, we have not so much to consider our own dispositions
towards others, as theirs towards us; a thousand caprices, interests,
and opinions, may intervene before the good understanding can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>mutual; we not only cannot infer of one individual from another, but
the same individual may change to-morrow: so that in our intercourse
with the world, there is nothing but littleness, uncertainty, suspicion,
and mortification, instead of the grandeur and repose of nature.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XI</h3>

<p class='c017'>It has been objected to the soothing power of Nature, that it
cannot take away the sharp pang of vehement distress, but rather barbs
the dart, and seems to smile in mockery of our anguish. But the
same might be said of music, poetry, and friendship, which only
tantalize and torment us by offering to divert our grief in its keenest
paroxysms; but yet cannot be denied to be enviable resources and
consolations of the human mind, when the bitterness of the moment
has passed over.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XII</h3>

<p class='c017'>Every one is a hero, the circumstances being given. All that is
necessary is, that the outward impression should be so strong as to
make a man forget himself. A woman rushes into the flames to save
her child, not from duty or reason—but because the distracting terror
for another banishes all recollection of, and fear for, herself. For the
same reason, a person throws himself from a precipice, because the
apprehension of danger gets the better of and confounds the sense of
self-preservation. The doctrine of self-love, as an infallible metaphysical
principle of action, is nonsense.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XIII</h3>

<p class='c017'>The heroical ages were those in which there was a constant
question between life and death, and men ate their scanty meal with
their swords in their hands.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XIV</h3>

<p class='c017'>The hero acts from outward impulse; the martyr from internal
faith, and so far is the greater character of the two. And yet it
may be doubted whether the latter is properly a voluntary agent, or
whether, if he could do it unperceived, he would not abstract himself
from the scene, instead of becoming a sacrifice and a witness to the
truth.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XV</h3>

<p class='c017'>What shews that persecution and danger act as incentives rather
than impediments to the will, is that zeal generally goes out with the
fires that kindle it; and we become indifferent to a cause, when life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>property, and limb are no longer endangered. He is the real philosopher
who loves truth for its own sake, not in the spirit of
contradiction: he the genuine friend of freedom and justice, who
hates oppression and wrong after they have ceased, and as long as the
very name of them remains, as well as while it is a bone of contention
between infuriated sects and parties.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XVI</h3>

<p class='c017'>If reform were to gain the day, reform would become as vulgar as
cant of any other kind. We only shew a spirit of independence and
resistance to power, as long as power is against us. As soon as the
cause of opposition prevails, its essence and character are gone out of
it; and the most flagrant <em>radicalism</em> degenerates into the tamest
servility. We then say as others say; sail with the stream; no
longer sacrifice interest to principle, but are in a pitiful majority.
Had events taken a different turn in 1794, who can predict what the
popular cry would have been? This may point out how little chance
there is of any great improvement in the affairs of the world. Virtue
ceases with difficulty; honesty is <em>militant</em>. The mass of mankind,
who are governed by indolence and habit, fall in with existing events
and interests; the imaginative and reasoning part fall out with facts
and reality; but could they have their way, and model the world at
their pleasure, their occupation would be gone; or if all governments
were wise and good, the character of the patriot would become
obsolete, and a sinecure. At present there is a very convenient
division of labour; and each class fulfils its vocation. It is essential
to the triumph of reform that it should never succeed.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XVII</h3>

<p class='c017'>We talk about the cant of politics or religion, as if there were no
cant but that which is common to the multitude. But whenever any
two individuals agree about any one thing, they begin to cant about it,
and take the echo of one another’s voices for the verdict of truth.
Half-a-dozen persons will always make a <em>quorum</em> of credulity and
vulgarity.</p>

<p class='c017'>When people have done quarrelling about one set of questions they
start another. Motion is necessary to mind as much as to matter;
and for ‘an ultimate end,’ Hobbes denies that there is any such thing.
Hence the tendency to all Ultra opinions and measures! Man is
seldom contented to go as far as others, unless he can go beyond them,
and make a caricature and a paradox even of the most vulgar prejudice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>It is necessary to aim at some kind of distinction—to create some
difficulty, were it only for the sake of overcoming it. Thus we find
that O’Connell, having carried his cause, would not let the ‘agitation’
subside without turning it into a personal quarrel: the way was
opened to him into the House, and he wanted to force his way there
by an <em>ex post facto</em> inference; the banns of marriage were published
between him and parliament, and he would fain, with the petulance of
opposition, <em>seize</em> a seat there.</p>

<p class='c017'>Erasmus, in his ‘Remains,’ tells a story of two thieves, who were
recommended by their mother to rob every one they met with; but
warned, on peril of their lives, to avoid one <em>Black-breeches</em> (Hercules).
Meeting him, however, without knowing him, they set upon him, and
were slung across his shoulder,—where Hercules heard them muttering
behind his back, <em>a long way off</em>, ‘This must surely be he that our
mother warned us of.’ In contempt and pity he let them escape.
What modern wit can come up to the grotesque grandeur of this
invention?</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XXI</h3>

<p class='c017'>People addicted to secresy are so without knowing why; they are
so not ‘for cause,’ but for secresy’s sake. It is a mixture of
cowardice and conceit. They think, if they tell you any thing, you
may understand it better than they do, or turn it in some way against
them; but that while they shut up their mouths they are wiser than
you, just as liars think by telling you a falsehood they have an
advantage over you. There are others who deal in significant nods,
smiles, and half-sentences, so that you never can get at their meaning,
and indeed they have none, but leave it to you to put what interpretation
you please on their embryo hints and conceptions. They are
glad to find a <em>proxy</em> for their want of understanding.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XXII</h3>

<p class='c017'>It is the force and violence of the English mind that has put it into
the safe custody of the law, and it is every man’s disposition to act
upon his own judgment and presumption, without regard to others,
that has made it absolutely necessary to establish equal claims to curb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>them. We are too much in a state of nature to submit to what Burke
calls ‘the soft collar of social esteem,’ and require ‘the iron rod, the
torturing hour,’ to tame us. But though the foundations of liberty,
life, and property, are formally secured in this way from the ebullitions
of national character, yet the spirit breaks out upon the surface of
manners, and is often spurted in our face. Lord Castlereagh was
wrong in saying that ‘liberty was merely a custom of England;’ it
is the indigenous growth of our temper and our clime; and woe to
him who deprives us of the only amends for so many disadvantages
and failings! The wild beast roaming his native forests is respectable
though formidable—shut up in Exeter ‘Change, he is equally odious
and wretched.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XXIII</h3>

<p class='c017'>It was a long time made an argument for not throwing open the
galleries of noblemen and others to the public, that if permission were
given they would be filled with the lowest of the rabble, and with
squalid wretches, who would run up against well-dressed people, and
damage the works of art. Nothing could be more false than this
theory, as experience has shown. It was in vain to quote the
example of foreign countries, as it was said the common people there
were kept more in subjection; but if they are tamer, ours are prouder
for that very reason. The National Gallery in Pall-Mall is now open
to all the world; and, except a shabby artist or two, who ever saw a
soul there who was not, if not well-dressed, yet dressed in his best,
and behaving with decency, instead of trying to turn the place into a
bear-garden, as had been predicted.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c008'><sup>[42]</sup></a> People will not go out of their
way to see pictures unless they have an interest in them, which gives
the title, and is a security against ill consequences; much less will
any class of people obtrude themselves where they are pointed at as
inferior to the rest of the company, or subject themselves to looks of
scorn and disgust, to see any sights in the world. There is no man
so poor or low but he loves himself better than pictures or statues;
and if he must get snubbed and treated with contempt to indulge his
admiration of celebrated works, he will forego the latter. <em>Comparisons
are odious</em>; and we avoid them. The first object of every human
being (high or low, great or small) is to stand well with himself, and
to appear to the best advantage to others. A man is not very fond of
passing along the streets in a thread-bare coat, and shoes with holes
in them. Will he go in this trim into a group of well-dressed people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>to make himself ridiculous? The mind, so far from being dull or
callous on this point, is but too sensitive; our jealousy of public
opinion is the ruling passion, a morbid disease. Does not the consciousness
of any singularity or impropriety of appearance immediately
take off from our pleasure at a play? How seldom we observe an
interloper in the dress circle; and how sure he is to pay for it! If
a man has any defect or inferiority, this is certain, he will keep it in
the back-ground. If a chimney-sweeper or scavenger had a ticket to
a ball, would he go? Oh! no; it is enough to bear the sense of our
own infirmity and disgrace in silence, and unnoticed, without having
it wrought to agony by the glare of contrast and ostentation of insult!
What linendraper or grocer’s son would dine with a prince every day
though he might, to be crushed into insignificance, and stifled with
ironical civility? Do we not observe the difficulty there is in making
servants and mechanics sit down, or keep on their hats in speaking to
their <em>betters</em>, for fear of being thought to encroach, and made liable
to a rebuff in consequence? Assuredly, then, the great may throw
open their palace-doors and galleries of art without having to dread
the inroad or outrages of the mob, or fancying that any one will go
who is not qualified to appear, or will not come away with his mind
and manners improved. The wooden shoes and mob caps in the
Louvre or the Vatican do no harm to the pictures on the walls: but
add a new interest to them, and throw a pleasing light on human
nature. If we are behind other nations in politeness and civilization,
the best way to overtake them is to tread in their steps.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XXIV</h3>

<p class='c017'>It is at the same time true that <em>familiarity breeds contempt</em>; or that
the vulgar, if admitted to an intimacy and footing of equality, try to
make you feel all your defects, and to pay for the superiority you
have so long usurped over them. The same pride that before kept
them at a distance makes them ready to throw down any barrier of
deference or distinction the moment they can do so with impunity.
No one willingly admits a superiority in another; or does not secretly
prefer himself to the whole universe beside. The slave would kill the
tyrant, whose feet he kisses; and there is no Turk so loyal that he
would not cut off the head of the best of Sultans, if he was sure of
putting the diadem upon his own.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XXV</h3>

<p class='c017'>The strongest minds are governed more by appearances than by a
regard to consequences. Those who pretend to be the greatest calculators
of their own interest, or the <em>main-chance</em>, are the very slaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>of opinion, and dupes of shallow pretension. They are often so mad
in this respect, that they think neither better nor worse of the oldest
friend they have in the world than the first person they happen to be
in company with does, or the last rumour they heard gives him out.
Their <em>circumspection</em> amounts to looking three ways at once, and
missing the right point of view at last. They would rather speak to
a well-dressed fool in the street than to the wisest man in a thread-bare
suit. I know an author who succeeds with a set of second-hand
thoughts by having a coat of the newest cut; and an editor, who
flourishes about the town in virtue of a pair of green spectacles. Lay
out all you are worth in decking out the person of a vulgar woman,
and she will <em>cut</em> you in the very finery you have given her; lay it out
on your own back, and she will be ambitious of your least notice.
People judge of you not from what <em>they</em> know, but from the impression
you make on others, which depends chiefly on professions, and on
outward bearing and bravery. <i><span lang="la">De non apparentibus et non existentibus
eadem est ratio.</span></i> If a man has no opinion of himself, how the deuce
should any one else? It is like electing a person member of parliament
who refuses to come forward as a candidate. On the other hand, let
a man have impudence in lieu of all other qualifications, and he needs
not despair. The part of quack or coxcomb is a favourite one with
the town. The only character that is likely to get on by passing for
a <em>poor creature</em> is the legacy-hunter. Nothing can be too low or
insignificant for that. A man is only grateful to you in the other
world for having been a foil to him in this. A miser (if he could)
would leave his fortune to his dog, that no human being might be the
better for it, or no one that he could envy in the possession of it, or
think raised to an equality with himself.</p>

<p class='c017'>We complain of old friends who have made their fortunes in the
world and slighted us in their prosperity, without considering those
who have been unsuccessful, and whom we have neglected in our
turn. When our friends betray or desert us, we cling the closer to
those that remain. Our confidence is strengthened by being circumscribed;
we do not wish to give up a forlorn hope. With the
crumbling and decayed fragments of friendship around us, we maintain
our point to the last; like the cobbler, who kept his stall and
cooked his beef-steak in the ruins of Drury Lane. Bonaparte used to
speak of old generals and favourites who would not have abandoned
him in his misfortunes if they had lived; it was perhaps well for them
that they were dead. The list of traitors and the ungrateful is too
much swelled without any probable additions to it.</p>

so easily cut the link of relationship asunder. We therefore
relieve the distresses of our near relations, or get them out of the

<p class='c017'>‘To be <em>direct</em> and honest is not safe,’ says Iago. Shakspeare has
here defined the nature of honesty, which seems to consist in the
absence of any <em>indirect</em> or sinister bias. The honest man looks at and
decides upon an object as it is in itself, without a view to consequences,
and as if he himself were entirely out of the question; the prudent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>man considers only what others will think of it; the knave, how he
can turn it to his own advantage or another’s detriment, which he
likes better. His straightforward simplicity of character is the
reverse of what is understood by the phrase, <em>a man of the world</em>: an
honest man is independent of and abstracted from material ties. This
character is owing chiefly to strong natural feeling and a love of right,
partly to pride and obstinacy, and a want of discursiveness of imagination.
It is not well to be too witty or too wise. In many circles
(not including the night-cellar or a mess-table) a clever fellow means
a rogue. According to the French proverb, ‘<i><span lang="fr">Tout homme reflechi est

<p class='c017'>A person who does not tell lies will not believe that others tell

words and things. This is to labour under a great disadvantage in
his transactions with <em>men of the world</em>: it is playing against sharpers
with loaded dice. The secret of plausibility and success is <em>point-blanc
lying</em>. The advantage which men of business have over the dreamers
and sleep-walkers is not in knowing the exact state of a case, but in
telling you with a grave face what it is not, to suit their own purposes.
This is one obvious reason why students and book-worms are so often

tradesman with the same annual profits would have been rich or
independent); an artist who breaks for ten thousand pounds cannot
surely lament the want of patronage. A sieve might as well petition
against a dry season. Persons of talent and reputation do not make
money, because they do not keep it; and they do not keep it, because
they do not care about it till they feel the want of it—and then <em>the

<p class='c017'>In general, however, it is not to be expected that those should
grow rich by a special Providence, whose first and last object is by
every means and at every sacrifice to grow famous. Vanity and
avarice have different goals and travel different roads. The man of
genius produces that which others admire: the man of business that
which they will buy. If the poet is delighted with the ideas of
certain things, the reader is equally satisfied with the idea of them
too. The man of genius does that which no one else but himself can
do: the man of business gets his wealth from the joint mechanical
drudgery of all whom he has the means to employ. Trade is the
Briareus that works with a hundred hands. A popular author grew
rich, because he seemed to have a hundred hands to write with: but
he wanted another hand to say to his well-got gains, ‘Come, let me
clutch thee.’ Nollekens made a fortune (how he saved it we know)
by having blocks of marble to turn into sharp-looking busts (which
required a capital), and by hiring a number of people to hack and
hew them into shape. Sir Joshua made more money than West or
Barry, partly because he was a better painter, partly because gentlemen
like their own portraits better than those of prophet or apostle,
saint or hero. What the individual wants, he will pay the highest
price for: what is done for the public the State must pay for. How
if they will not? The historical painter cannot make them; and if
he persists in the attempt, must be contented to fall a martyr to it.

Can he with equal certainty of the issue introduce her to his friends

institution, and a wife a part of the machinery of society. We are
not in a state of nature, to be quite free and unshackled to follow our

woman’s being a paragon of wit or beauty; but every man fancies
his Dulcinea a paragon of wit or beauty. Without this, he will only
(with the best intentions in the world) have entailed chagrin and
mortification both on himself and her; and she will be as much
excluded from society as if he had made her his mistress instead of

value of time must mount up, as it proceeds, through the positive,
comparative, and superlative degrees. Common sense with a little
reflection will teach us, that one age is as good as another; that in
familiar phrase <em>we cannot have our cake and eat it</em>; and that there is
no time like the time present, whether in the first, the tenth or the
twentieth century.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XLVIII</h3>

<p class='c017'>The world does not start fair in the race of time: one country
has run its course before another has set out or even been heard of.
Riches, luxury, and the arts, reach their utmost height in one place, while
the rest of the globe is in a crude and barbarous state; decline thenceforward,
and can no more be resuscitated than the dead. The twelve
old Etruscan cities are stone-walls, surrounded with heaps of cinders:
Rome is but the tomb of its ancient greatness. Venice, Genoa, are
extinct; and there are those who think that England has had her
day. She may exclaim in the words of Gray’s <em>Bard</em>—‘To triumph
and to die are mine.’ America is just setting out in the path of
history, on the model of England, without a language of its own, and
with a continent instead of an island to run its career in—like a novice
in the art, who gets a larger canvass than his master ever had to cover
with his second-hand designs.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>XLIX</h3>

<p class='c017'>It was shrewdly observed that the ruin of states commences with
the accumulation of people in great cities, which conceal and foster
vice and profligacy.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>L</h3>

<p class='c017'>The world, said a sensible man, does not on the whole grow much
worse, nor abandon itself to absolute licentiousness, because as people
have children growing up, they do not wish them to be reprobates;
but give them good advice and conceal their failings from them.
This in each successive generation brings morality on its legs again,
however sceptical in virtue or hardened in vice the old may become
through habit or bad example.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LI</h3>

<p class='c017'>As children puzzle you by asking explanations of what they do not
understand, many grown people shine in company and triumph over
their antagonists by dint of ignorance and conceit.</p>

<p class='c017'>A certain bookseller wanted Northcote to write a history of art in
all ages and countries, and in all its ramifications and collateral
bearings. It would have taken a life to execute it; but the projector
thought it was as easy to make the book as to draw up the title-page.
Some minds are as sanguine from a want of imagination, as others are
from an excess of it; they see no difficulty or objection in the way of
what they undertake, and are blind to every thing but their own
interest and wishes.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LIII</h3>

<p class='c017'>An outcry is raised against the distresses of literature as a tax upon
the public, and against the sums of money and unrepaid loans which
authors borrow of strangers or friends. It is not considered that but
for authors we should still have been in the hands of tyrants, who
rioted in the spoil of widows and orphans, and swept the fortunes of
individuals and the wealth of provinces into their pouch. It will be
time enough to be alarmed when the <em>Literary Fund</em> has laid its iron
grasp on fat abbey lands and portly monasteries for the poor brethren
of the Muses, has establishments like those of the Franciscan and
Dominican Friars for its hoary veterans or tender novices, and has
laid half the property of the country under contribution. Authors
are the <em>ideal</em> class of the present day, who supply the brains of the
community with ‘fancies and good-nights,’ as the priests did of old;
and who cultivating no goodly vineyard of their own to satisfy the
wants of the body, are sometimes entitled, besides their pittance, to
ask the protection of taste or liberality. After all, the fees of
Parnassus are trifling in comparison with the toll of Purgatory.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LIV</h3>

<p class='c017'>There are but few authors who should marry: they are already
wedded to their studies and speculations. Those who are accustomed
to the airy regions of poetry and romance, have a fanciful and peculiar
standard of perfection of their own, to which realities can seldom
come up; and disappointment, indifference, or disgust, is too often the
result. Besides, their ideas and their intercourse with society make
them fit for the highest matches. If an author, baulked of the goddess
of his idolatry, marries an ignorant and narrow-minded person, they
have no language in common: if she is a <em>bluestocking</em>, they do nothing
but wrangle. Neither have most writers the means to maintain a
wife and family without difficulty. They have chosen their part, the
pursuit of the intellectual and abstracted; and should not attempt to
force the world of reality into a union with it, like mixing gold with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>clay. In this respect, the Romish priests were perhaps wiser.
‘From every work they challenged <em>essoin</em> for contemplation’s sake.’
Yet their celibacy was but a compromise with their sloth and supposed
sanctity. We must not contradict the course of nature, after all.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LV</h3>

<p class='c017'>There is sometimes seen more natural ease and grace in a common
gipsy-girl than in an English court-circle. To demand a reason why,
is to ask why the strolling fortune-teller’s hair and eyes are black, or
her face oval.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LVI</h3>

<p class='c017'>The greatest proof of pride is its being able to extinguish envy and
jealousy. Vanity produces the latter effect on the continent.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LVII</h3>

<p class='c017'>When you speak of the popular effect and enthusiasm produced by
the ceremonies of the Catholic church, it is presently objected that
all this faith and zeal is excited by mummery and superstition. I
am ready to allow that; and when I find that truth and reason have
the same homage and reverence paid to them as absurdity and falsehood,
I shall think all the advantages are clearly on the side of the
former. The processes of reason do not commonly afford the elements
of passion as their result; and the object of strong and even
lofty feeling seems to appeal rather to the grossness and incongruity of
the senses and imagination, than to the clear and dry deductions of
the understanding. Man has been truly defined a <em>religious animal</em>;
but his faith and heavenward aspirations cease if you reduce him to a
mere mathematical machine. The glory and the power of the true
religion are in its enlisting the affections of man along with the
understanding.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LVIII</h3>

<p class='c017'>We are imposed upon by the affectation of grace and gentility only
till we see the reality; and then we laugh at the counterfeit, and are
surprised that we did not see through it before.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LIX</h3>

<p class='c017'>English women, even of the highest rank, look like <em>dowdies</em> in
Paris; or exactly as countrywomen do in London. It is a <em>rule-of-three</em>
proportion. A French milliner or servant maid laughs (not
without reason) at an English Duchess. The more our fair country
women dress <em>à la Française</em>, the more unlucky they seem; and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>more foreign graces they give themselves, the more awkward they
grow. They want the <em>tournure</em> Françoise. Oh! how we have
‘melted, thawed, and dissolved into a dew,’ to see a bustling, red-faced,
bare-necked English Duchess, or banker’s wife, come into a
box at the French theatre, bedizened and bedaubed! My Lady-mayoress
or the Right Honourable the Countess Dowager of ——,
before she ventures on the word <em>vulgar</em>, or scorns her untitled and
untutored neighbours as beneath her notice, should go to see <em>les
Angloises pour rire</em>! <em>That</em> is the looking-glass for upstart wealth and
inflated aristocracy.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LX</h3>

<p class='c017'>The advantage of our nobility over the plebeian classes is said to
be in the blood and in the breed—the Norman breed, we suppose—the
high noses and arched eyebrows date from the Conquest. We
plead guilty to the insinuation conveyed in the expression—‘the
coronet face’—and bow with some sort of pride to the pride of
birth. But this hypothesis is hardly compatible with the evident
improvement in the present generation of noblemen and gentlemen by
the intermarriages with rich heiresses, or the beautiful Pamelas of an
humbler stock. <em>Crossing the breed</em> has done much good; for the
actual race of Bond-street loungers would make a very respectable
regiment of grenadiers; and the satire on Beau Didapper, in
Fielding’s Joseph Andrews, has lost its force.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LXI</h3>

<p class='c017'>The tone of society in Paris is very far from John Bullish. They
do not ask what a man is worth, or whether his father is owner of a
tin-mine or a borough—but what he has to say, whether he is amiable
and <em>spirituel</em>. In the case (unless a marriage is on the <em>tapis</em>) no one
inquires whether his account at his banker’s is high or low; or
whether he has come in his carriage or on foot. An English soldier
of fortune, or a great traveller, is listened to with some attention as a
<em>marked character</em>; while a booby lord is no more regarded than his
own footman in livery. The blank after a man’s name is expected
to be filled up with talent or adventures, or he passes for what he
really is, a cypher.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LXII</h3>

<p class='c017'>Our young Englishmen in Paris do not make much figure in the
society of Frenchmen of education and spirit. They stumble at the
threshold in point of manners, dress, and conversation. They have
not only to learn the language, but to <em>unlearn</em> almost every thing else.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Both words and things are different in France; our raw recruits
have to get rid of a host of prejudices, and they do it awkwardly and
reluctantly, and if they attempt to make a regular stand, are presently
out-voted. The terms <em>gothic</em> and <em>barbarous</em> are talisman to strike
them dumb. There is, moreover, a clumsiness in both their wit and
advances to familiarity, that the spiteful <em>brunettes</em> on the other side of
the water do not comprehend, and that subjects them to constant
sneers; and every false step adds to their confusion and want of
confidence. But their lively antagonists are so flushed with victory
and victims to their loquacity and charms, that they are not contented
to lecture them on morals, metaphysics, sauces, and <em>virtù</em>, but proceed
to teach them the true pronunciation and idiom of the English tongue.
Thus a smart French widow having blundered by saying, ‘I have
never <em>made</em> a child;’ and perceiving that it excited a smile, maintained,
for three whole days, against a large company, that it was
better than saying, ‘I never <em>had</em> a child.’</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LXIII</h3>

<p class='c017'>The Parisian <em>trip</em> (say what they will) is not grace. It is the
motion of a puppet, and may be mimicked, which grace <em>cannot</em>. It
may be different from the high, heavy-heeled walk of the Englishwoman.
Is it not equally remote from the step (if step it may be
called) of an Andalusian girl?</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LXIV</h3>

<p class='c017'>It has been often made a subject of dispute, What is the distinguishing
characteristic of man? And the answer may, perhaps, be given
that <em>he is the only animal that dresses</em>. He is the only being who is
coxcomb enough not to go out of the world naked as he came into it;
that is ashamed of what he really is, and proud of what he is not;
and that tries to pass off an artificial disguise as himself. We may
safely extend the old maxim, and say that it is the tailor that makes
both the gentleman and the man. <em>Fine feathers make fine birds</em>—this lie
is the motto of the human mind. Dress a fellow in sheepskin, and he
is a clown—dress him in scarlet, and he is a gentleman. It is then
the clothes that makes all the difference; and the moral agent is
simply the lay-figure to hang them on. Man, in short, is the only
creature in the known world, with whom appearances pass for realities,
words for things; or that has the wit to find out his own defects,
and the impudence and hypocrisy, by merely concealing them, to
persuade himself and others that he has them not. Teniers’s monkeys,
habited like monks, may be thought a satire on human nature—alas!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>it is a piece of natural history. The monks are the larger and more
solemn species, to be sure. Swift has taken a good bird’s eye view of
man’s nature, by abstracting the habitual notions of size, and looking
at it in <em>great</em> or in <em>little</em>: would that some one had the boldness and
the art to do a similar service, by stripping off the coat from his back,
the vizor from his thoughts, or by dressing up some other creature
in similar mummery! It is not his body alone that he tampers with,
and metamorphoses so successfully; he tricks out his mind and soul
in borrowed finery, and in the admired costume of gravity and
imposture. If he has a desire to commit a base or cruel action
without remorse and with the applause of the spectators, he has only
to throw the cloak of religion over it, and invoke Heaven to set its
seal on a massacre or a robbery. At one time dirt, at another
indecency, at another rapine, at a fourth rancorous malignity, is
decked out and accredited in the garb of sanctity. The instant there
is a flaw, a ‘damned spot’ to be concealed, it is glossed over with a
doubtful name. Again, we dress up our enemies in nicknames, and
they march to the stake as assuredly as in <em>san Benitos</em>. The words
Heretic or Papist, Jew or Infidel, labelled on those who differ from
us, stand us in lieu of sense or decency. If a man be mean, he sets
up for economy; if selfish, he pretends to be prudent; if harsh,
firm; and so on. What enormities, what follies are not undertaken
for the love of glory?—and the worst of all, are said to be for the
glory of God! Strange, that a reptile should wish to be thought an
angel; or that he should not be content to writhe and grovel in his
native earth, without aspiring to the skies! It is from the love of
dress and finery. He is the Chimney-sweeper on May-day all the
year round: the soot peeps through the rags and tinsel, and all the
flowers of sentiment!</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LXV</h3>

<p class='c017'>The meaning of all which is, that man is the only hypocrite in the
creation; or that he is composed of two natures, the <em>ideal</em> and the
<em>physical</em>, the one of which he is always trying to keep a secret from
the other. He is the <em>Centaur not fabulous</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LXVI</h3>

<p class='c017'>A person who is full of secrets is a knave or a fool, or both.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LXVII</h3>

<p class='c017'>The error of Mandeville, as well as of those opposed to him, is in
concluding that man is a simple and not a compound being. The
schoolmen and divines endeavour to prove that the gross and material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>part of his nature is a foreign admixture, distinct from and unworthy
of the man himself. The misanthropes and sceptics, on the other
hand, maintain the <em>falsity of all human virtues</em>, and that all that is not
sensual and selfish is a mere theatrical deception. But in order that
man should be a wholly and incorrigibly selfish being, he should be
shut up like an oyster in its shell, without any possible conception of
what passes beyond the wall of his senses; and the <em>feelers</em> of his mind
should not extend their ramifications under any circumstance or in
any manner, to the thoughts and sentiments of others. Shakspeare
has expressed the matter better than the pedants on either side, who
wish unreasonably to exalt or degrade human nature.—‘The web of
our lives is as of a mingled yarn, good and ill together: our virtues
would be proud, if our faults whipped them not, and our vices would
despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.’</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LXVIII</h3>

<p class='c017'>People cry out against the preposterous absurdity of such representations
as the German inventions of the <em>Devil’s Elixir</em> and the <em>Bottle
Imp</em>. Is it then a fiction that we see? Or is it not rather a palpable
reality that takes place every day and hour? Who is there that is
not haunted by some heated phantom of his brain, some wizard spell,
that clings to him in spite of his will, and hurries him on to absurdity
or ruin? There is no machinery or phantasmagoria of a melo-drame,
more extravagant than the workings of the passions. Mr. Farley may
do his worst with scaly forms, with flames, and dragon’s wings: but
after all, the true demon is within us. How many, whose senses are
shocked at the outward spectacle, and who turn away startled or
disgusted might say, pointing to their bosoms, ‘<em>The moral is here!</em>’</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LXIX</h3>

<p class='c017'>Mr. L—— asked Sir Thomas —— who had been intimate with
the Prince, if it was true that he was so fine a gentleman as he was
generally represented? Sir Thomas —— made answer, that it was
certainly true that the Prince was a very fine gentleman indeed: ‘but,’
added he, ‘if I am to speak my mind, the finest gentleman I ever
saw, was Sadi Baba, the ambassador to Constantinople, from the
Usbek Tartars.’</p>

<h3 class='c018'>LXX</h3>

<p class='c017'>‘Man is in no haste to be venerable.’ At present, it seems as if
there were no occasion to become so. People die as usual; but it is
not the fashion to grow old. Formerly, men subsided and settled
down into a respectable old age at forty, as they did into a bob-wig,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>and a brown coat and waistcoat of a certain cut. The father of a
family no longer pretended to pass for a gay young fellow, after he
had children grown up; and women dwindled, by regular and willing
gradations, into mothers and grandmothers, transferring their charms
and pretensions to a blooming posterity; but these things are never
thought of now-a-days. A matron of sixty flaunts it in ‘La Belle
Assemblée’s dresses for May:’ and certainly M. Stultz never
inquires into the grand climacteric of his customers. Dress levels
all ages as well as all ranks.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Monthly Magazine.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>November, 1830.</em></span></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Editors are (to use an approved Scotch phrase—for what that is
Scotch is not approved?) a ‘sort of <em>tittle-tattle</em>‘—difficult to deal
with, dangerous to discuss. ‘A capital subject for an article, great
scope, complete novelty, and ground never touched upon!’ Very
true; for what Editor would insert an article against himself?
Certainly none that did not feel himself free from and superior to the
common foibles of his tribe. What might, therefore, be taken for
a satire in manuscript, turns to a compliment in print—the exception
in this, as in other cases, proves the rule—an inference we have
endeavoured to express in our motto.</p>

<p class='c007'>With one exception, then, Editors in general partake of the usual
infirmity of human nature, and of persons placed in high and honorary
situations. Like other individuals raised to authority, they are chosen
to fill a certain post for qualities useful or ornamental to the <em>reading
public</em>; but they soon fancy that the situation has been invented for
their own honour and profit, and sink the use in the abuse. Kings
are not the only servants of the public who imagine that they are the
<em>state</em>. Editors are but men, and easily ‘lay the flattering unction to
their souls’ that they <em>are</em> the Magazine, the Newspaper, or the Review
they conduct. They have got a little power in their hands, and they
wish to employ that power (as all power is employed) to increase the
sense of self-importance; they borrow a certain dignity from their
situation as arbiters and judges of taste and elegance, and they are
determined to keep it to the detriment of their employers and of every
one else. They are dreadfully afraid there should be any thing
behind the Editor’s chair, greater than the Editor’s chair. That is
a scandal to be prevented at all risks. The publication they are
entrusted with for the amusement and edification of the town, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>convert, in theory and practice, into a stalking-horse of their own
vanity, whims, and prejudices. They cannot write a whole work
themselves, but they take care that the whole is such as they might
have written: it is to have the Editor’s mark, like the broad R, on
every page, or the N. N. at the Tuileries; it is to bear the same
image and superscription—every line is to be upon oath: nothing is
to be differently conceived or better expressed than the Editor could
have done it. The whole begins in vanity, and ends too often in
dulness and insipidity.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is utterly impossible to persuade an Editor that he is nobody.
As Mr. Horne Tooke said, on his trial for a libel before Lord
Kenyon, ‘There are two parties in this cause—myself and the jury;
the judge and the crier of the court attend in their respective places:’
so in every periodical miscellany, there are two essential parties—the
writers and the public; the Editor and the printer’s-devil are merely
the mechanical instruments to bring them together. There is a secret
consciousness of this on the part of the Conductor of the Literary
Diligence, that his place is one for shew and form rather than use;
and as he cannot maintain his pretended superiority by what he does
himself, he thinks to arrive at the same end by hindering others from
doing their best. The ‘dog-in-the-manger’ principle comes into full
play. If an article has nothing to recommend it, is one of no mark
or likelihood, it goes in; there is no offence in it. If it is likely to
strike, to draw attention, to make a noise, then every syllable is
scanned, every objection is weighed: if grave, it is too grave; if
witty, it is too witty. One way or other, it might be better; and
while this nice point is pending, it gives place, as a matter of course,
to something that there is no question about.</p>

<p class='c007'>The responsibility, the delicacy, the nervous apprehension of the
Editor, naturally increase with the probable effect and popularity of
the contributions on which he has to pass judgment; and the nearer
an effusion approaches to perfection, the more fatal is a single flaw, or
its falling short of that superhuman standard by a hair’s-breadth difference,
to its final reception. If people are likely to ask, ‘Who wrote
a certain paper in the last number of ——?’ the Editor is bound, as
a point of honour, to baulk that impertinent curiosity on the part of
the public. He would have it understood that all the articles are
equally good, and may be equally his own. If he inserts a paper of
more than the allowed average merit, his next care is to spoil by
revising it. The sting, with the honey, is sure to be left out. If
there is any thing that pleased you in the writing, you look in vain
for it in the proof. What might electrify the reader, startles the
Editor. With a paternal regard for the interests of the public, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>takes care that their tastes should not be pampered, and their expectations
raised too high, by a succession of fine passages, of which it is
impossible to continue a supply. He interposes between the town
and their vicious appetite for the piquant and high-seasoned, as we
forbid children to indulge in sweetmeats. The trite and superficial
are always to be had <em>to order</em>, and present a beautiful uniformity of
appearance. There is no unexpected relief, no unwelcome inequality
of style, to disorder the nerves or perplex the understanding: the
reader may read, and smile, and sleep, without meeting a single idea
to break his repose!</p>

<p class='c007'>Some Editors, moreover, have a way of altering the first paragraph:
they have then exercised their privileges, and let you alone for the
rest of the chapter. This is like paying ‘a pepper-corn rent,’ or
making one’s bow on entering a room: it is being let off cheap.
Others add a pointless conclusion of their own: it is like signing their
names to the article. Some have a passion for sticking in the word
<em>however</em> at every opportunity, in order to impede the march of the
style; and others are contented and take great pains (with Lindley
Murray’s Grammar lying open before them) to alter ‘if it <em>is</em>’ into ‘if
it <em>be</em>.’ An Editor abhors an ellipsis. If you fling your thoughts into
continued passages, they set to work to cut them up into short paragraphs:
if you make frequent breaks, they turn the tables on you that
way, and throw the whole composition into masses. Any thing to
preserve the form and appearance of power, to make the work their
own by mental stratagem, to stamp it by some fiction of criticism with
their personal identity, to enable them to run away with the credit,
and look upon themselves as the master-spirits of the work and of the
age! If there is any point they do not understand, they are sure to
meddle with it, and mar the sense; for it piques their self-love, and
they think they are bound <em>ex-officio</em> to know better than the writer.
Thus they substitute (at a venture, and merely for the sake of altering)
one epithet for another, when perhaps the same word has occurred
just before, and produces a cruel tautology, never considering the
trouble you have taken to compare the context and vary the
phraseology.</p>

<p class='c007'>Editors have no misplaced confidence in the powers of their contributors:
they think by the supposition they must be in the right
from a single supercilious glance,—and you in the wrong, after poring
over a subject for a month. There are Editors who, if you insert the
name of a popular actor or artist, strike it out, and, in virtue of their
authority, insert a favourite of their own,—as a dexterous attorney
substitutes the name of a friend in a will. Some Editors will let you
praise nobody; others will let you blame nobody. The first excites
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>their jealousy of contemporary merit; the last excites their fears, and
they do not like to make enemies. Some insist upon giving no
opinion at all, and observe an <em>unarmed neutrality</em> as to all parties and
persons;—it is no wonder the world think very little of them in return.
Some Editors stand upon their characters for this; others for that.
Some pique themselves upon being genteel and well-dressed; others
on being moral and immaculate, and do not perceive that the public
never trouble their heads about the matter. We only know one
Editor who openly discards all regard to character and decency, and
who thrives by the dissolution of partnership, if indeed the articles
were ever drawn up. We shall not mention names, as we would not
advertise a work that ‘ought to lie on no gentleman’s table.’ Some
Editors drink tea with a set of <em>blue stockings</em> and literary ladies: not
a whisper, not a breath that might blow away those fine cobwebs of
the brain—</p>

    </div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Others dine with Lords and Academicians—for God’s sake, take
care what you say! Would you strip the Editor’s mantel-piece of
the cards of invitation that adorn it to select parties for the next six
months? An Editor takes a turn in St. James’s-street, and is congratulated
by the successive literary or political groups on all he does
<em>not</em> write; and when the mistake is found out, the true Simon Pure
is dismissed. We have heard that it was well said by the proprietor
of a leading journal, that he would take good care never to write a
line in his own paper, as he had conflicting interests enough to manage,
without adding literary jealousies to the number. On the other hand,
a very good-natured and warm-hearted individual declared, ‘he would
never have another man of talents for an Editor’ (the Editor, in this
case, is to the proprietor as the author to the Editor), ‘for he was
tired of having their good things thrust in his teeth.’ Some Editors
are scrubs, mere drudges, newspaper-puffs: others are bullies or
quacks: others are nothing at all—they have the name, and receive
a salary for it! A literary sinecure is at once lucrative and highly
respectable. At Lord’s-Ground there are some old hands that are
famous for ‘<em>blocking out and staying in</em>:’ it would seem that some of
our literary veterans had taken a lesson from their youthful exercises
at Harrow or Eton.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this is bad enough; but the worst is, that Editors, besides their
own failings, have <em>friends</em> who aggravate and take advantage of them.
These self-styled friends are the night-shade and hemlock clinging to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>the work, preventing its growth and circulation, and dropping a
slumberous poison from its jaundiced leaves. They form a <em>cordon</em>,
an opake mass round the Editor, and persuade him that they are the
support, the prop, and pillar of his reputation. They get between
him and the public, and shut out the light, and set aside common sense.
They pretend anxiety for the interest of some established
organ of opinion, while all they want is to make it the organ of their
dogmas, prejudices, or party. They want to be the Magazine or the
Review—to wield that power covertly, to warp that influence to their
own purposes. If they cannot do this, they care not if it sinks or
swims. They prejudge every question—fly-blow every writer who is
not of their own set. A friend of theirs has three articles in the last
number of ——; they strain every nerve and make pressing instances
to throw a slur on a popular contribution by another hand, in order
that he may write a fourth in the next number. The short articles
which are read by the vulgar, are cut down to make room for the
long ones, which are read by nobody but the writers and their friends.
If an opinion is expressed contrary to the shibboleth of the party, it
is represented as an outrage on decency and public opinion, when in
truth the public are delighted with the candour and boldness displayed.
They would convert the most valuable and spirited journal into a dull
pamphleteer, stuffed with their own lucubrations on certain heavy
topics. The self-importance of these people is in proportion to their
insignificance; and what they cannot do by an appeal to argument or
sound policy, they effect by importunity and insinuation. They keep
the Editor in continual alarm as to what will be said of him by the
public, when in fact the public will think (in nine cases out of ten)
just what he tells them.</p>

<p class='c007'>These people create much of the mischief. An Editor should
have no friends—his only prompter should be the number of copies
of the work that sell. It is superfluous to strike off a large impression
of a work for those few squeamish persons who prefer lead to tinsel.
Principle and good manners are barriers that are, in our estimate,
inviolable: the rest is open to popular suffrage, and is not to be prejudged
by a <em>coterie</em> with closed doors. Another difficulty lies here.
An Editor should, in one sense, be a respectable man—a distinguished
character; otherwise, he cannot lend his name and sanction to the
work. The conductor of a periodical publication which is to circulate
widely and give the tone to taste and opinion, ought to be of high
standing, should have connections with society, should belong to some
literary institution, should be courted by the great, be run after by the
obscure. But ‘here’s the rub’—that one so graced and gifted can
neither have his time nor his thoughts to himself. Our obligations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>are mutual; and those who owe much to others, become the slaves of
their good opinion and good word. He who dines out loses his free
agency. He may improve in politeness; he falls off in the pith and
pungency of his style. A poem is dedicated to the son of the Muses:—can
the critic do otherwise than praise it? A tragedy is brought
out by a noble friend and patron:—the severe rules of the drama
must yield in some measure to the amenities of private life. On the
contrary, Mr. —— is a garretteer—a person that nobody knows; his
work has nothing but the <em>contents</em> to recommend it; it sinks into
obscurity, or addresses itself to the <em>canaille</em>. An Editor, then, should
be an abstraction—a being in the clouds—a mind without a body—reason
without passion.——But where find such a one?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE LETTER-BELL</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Monthly Magazine.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>March, 1831.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>Complaints are frequently made of the vanity and shortness of human
life, when, if we examine its smallest details, they present a world by
themselves. The most trifling objects, retraced with the eye of
memory, assume the vividness, the delicacy, and importance of
insects seen through a magnifying glass. There is no end of the
brilliancy or the variety. The habitual feeling of the love of life
may be compared to ‘one entire and perfect chrysolite,’ which, if
analysed, breaks into a thousand shining fragments. Ask the
sum-total of the value of human life, and we are puzzled with the
length of the account, and the multiplicity of items in it: take any
one of them apart, and it is wonderful what matter for reflection will
be found in it! As I write this, the <em>Letter-Bell</em> passes: it has a
lively, pleasant sound with it, and not only fills the street with its
importunate clamour, but rings clear through the length of many
half-forgotten years. It strikes upon the ear, it vibrates to the brain,
it wakes me from the dream of time, it flings me back upon my first
entrance into life, the period of my first coming up to town, when
all around was strange, uncertain, adverse—a hubbub of confused
noises, a chaos of shifting objects—and when this sound alone,
startling me with the recollection of a letter I had to send to the
friends I had lately left, brought me as it were to myself, made me
feel that I had links still connecting me with the universe, and gave
me hope and patience to persevere. At that loud-tinkling, interrupted
sound (now and then), the long line of blue hills near the
place where I was brought up waves in the horizon, a golden sunset
hovers over them, the dwarf-oaks rustle their red leaves in the eveningbreeze,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>and the road from —— to ——, by which I first set out on
my journey through life, stares me in the face as plain, but from time
and change not less visionary and mysterious, than the pictures in
the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>. I should notice, that at this time the light
of the French Revolution circled my head like a glory, though
dabbled with drops of crimson gore: I walked comfortable and
cheerful by its side—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And by the vision splendid</div>
      <div class='line'>Was on my way attended.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It rose then in the east: it has again risen in the west. Two suns
in one day, two triumphs of liberty in one age, is a miracle which I
hope the Laureate will hail in appropriate verse. Or may not Mr.
Wordsworth give a different turn to the fine passage, beginning—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What, though the radiance which was once so bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>Be now for ever vanished from my sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though nothing can bring back the hour</div>
      <div class='line'>Of glory in the grass, of splendour in the flower?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For is it not brought back, ‘like morn risen on mid-<em>night</em>‘; and may
he not yet greet the yellow light shining on the evening bank with
eyes of youth, of genius, and freedom, as of yore? No, never!
But what would not these persons give for the unbroken integrity of
their early opinions—for one unshackled, uncontaminated strain—one
<em>Io pæan</em> to Liberty—one burst of indignation against tyrants and
sycophants, who subject other countries to slavery by force, and
prepare their own for it by servile sophistry, as we see the huge
serpent lick over its trembling, helpless victim with its slime and
poison, before it devours it! On every stanza so penned should be
written the word <span class='sc'>Recreant</span>! Every taunt, every reproach, every
note of exultation at restored light and freedom, would recal to them
how their hearts failed them in the Valley of the Shadow of Death.
And what shall we say to <em>him</em>—the sleep-walker, the dreamer, the
sophist, the word-hunter, the craver after sympathy, but still vulnerable
to truth, accessible to opinion, because not sordid or mechanical?
The Bourbons being no longer tied about his neck, he may perhaps
recover his original liberty of speculating; so that we may apply to
him the lines about his own <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And from his neck so free</div>
      <div class='line'>The Albatross fell off, and sank</div>
      <div class='line'>Like lead into the sea.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This is the reason I can write an article on the <em>Letter-Bell</em>, and other
such subjects; I have never given the lie to my own soul. If I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>have felt any impression once, I feel it more strongly a second time;
and I have no wish to revile or discard my best thoughts. There
is at least a thorough <em>keeping</em> in what I write—not a line that betrays
a principle or disguises a feeling. If my wealth is small, it all goes
to enrich the same heap; and trifles in this way accumulate to a
tolerable sum. Or if the Letter-Bell does not lead me a dance into
the country, it fixes me in the thick of my town recollections, I
know not how long ago. It was a kind of alarm to break off from
my work when there happened to be company to dinner or when I
was going to the play. <em>That</em> was going to the play, indeed, when
I went twice a year, and had not been more than half a dozen times
in my life. Even the idea that any one else in the house was going,
was a sort of reflected enjoyment, and conjured up a lively anticipation
of the scene. I remember a Miss D——, a maiden lady from
Wales (who in her youth was to have been married to an earl),
tantalised me greatly in this way, by talking all day of going to see
Mrs. Siddons’ ‘airs and graces’ at night in some favourite part; and
when the Letter-Bell announced that the time was approaching, and
its last receding sound lingered on the ear, or was lost in silence, how
anxious and uneasy I became, lest she and her companion should
not be in time to get good places—lest the curtain should draw up
before they arrived—and lest I should lose one line or look in the
intelligent report which I should hear the next morning! The
punctuating of time at that early period—every thing that gives it an
articulate voice—seems of the utmost consequence; for we do not
know what scenes in the <em>ideal</em> world may run out of them: a world
of interest may hang upon every instant, and we can hardly sustain
the weight of future years which are contained in embryo in the most
minute and inconsiderable passing events. How often have I put off
writing a letter till it was too late! How often had to run after the
postman with it—now missing, now recovering the sound of his bell—breathless,
angry with myself—then hearing the welcome sound
come full round a corner—and seeing the scarlet costume which set
all my fears and self-reproaches at rest! I do not recollect having
ever repented giving a letter to the postman, or wishing to retrieve it
after he had once deposited it in his bag. What I have once set
my hand to, I take the consequences of, and have been always
pretty much of the same humour in this respect. I am not like the
person who, having sent off a letter to his mistress, who resided a
hundred and twenty miles in the country, and disapproving, on
second thoughts, of some expressions contained in it, took a post-chaise
and four to follow and intercept it the next morning. At
other times, I have sat and watched the decaying embers in a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span><em>back</em> painting-room (just as the wintry day declined), and brooded
over the half-finished copy of a Rembrandt, or a landscape by
Vangoyen, placing it where it might catch a dim gleam of light
from the fire; while the Letter-Bell was the only sound that drew
my thoughts to the world without, and reminded me that I had a
task to perform in it. As to that landscape, methinks I see it now—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The slow canal, the yellow-blossomed vale,</div>
      <div class='line'>The willow-tufted bank, the gliding sail.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There was a windmill, too, with a poor low clay-built cottage
beside it:—how delighted I was when I had made the tremulous,
undulating reflection in the water, and saw the dull canvas become
a lucid mirror of the commonest features of nature! Certainly,
painting gives one a strong interest in nature and humanity (it is not
the <em>dandy-school</em> of morals or sentiment)—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘While with an eye made quiet by the power</div>
      <div class='line'>Of harmony and the deep power of joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>We see into the life of things.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps there is no part of a painter’s life (if we must tell ‘the
secrets of the prison-house’) in which he has more enjoyment of
himself and his art, than that in which after his work is over, and
with furtive, sidelong glances at what he has done, he is employed in
washing his brushes and cleaning his pallet for the day. Afterwards,
when he gets a servant in livery to do this for him, he may have
other and more ostensible sources of satisfaction—greater splendour,
wealth, or fame; but he will not be so wholly in his art, nor will
his art have such a hold on him as when he was too poor to transfer
its meanest drudgery to others—too humble to despise aught that had
to do with the object of his glory and his pride, with that on which
all his projects of ambition or pleasure were founded. ‘Entire
affection scorneth nicer hands.’ When the professor is above this
mechanical part of his business, it may have become a <em>stalking-horse</em>
to other worldly schemes, but is no longer his <em>hobby-horse</em> and the
delight of his inmost thoughts—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘His shame in crowds, his solitary pride!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I used sometimes to hurry through this part of my occupation, while
the Letter-Bell (which was my dinner-bell) summoned me to the
fraternal board, where youth and hope</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Made good digestion wait on appetite</div>
      <div class='line'>And health on both—’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>or oftener I put it off till after dinner, that I might loiter longer and
with more luxurious indolence over it, and connect it with the
thoughts of my next day’s labours.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dustman’s bell, with its heavy, monotonous noise, and the
brisk, lively tinkle of the muffin-bell, have something in them, but
not much. They will bear dilating upon with the utmost licence of
inventive prose. All things are not alike <em>conductors</em> to the imagination.
A learned Scotch professor found fault with an ingenious
friend and arch-critic for cultivating a rookery on his grounds: the
professor declared ‘he would as soon think of encouraging a <em>froggery</em>.’
This was barbarous as it was senseless. Strange, that a country that
has produced the Scotch novels and Gertrude of Wyoming should
want sentiment!</p>

<p class='c007'>The postman’s double knock at the door the next morning is
‘more germain to the matter.’ How that knock often goes to the
heart! We distinguish to a nicety the arrival of the Two-penny or
the General Post. The summons of the latter is louder and heavier,
as bringing news from a greater distance, and as, the longer it has
been delayed, fraught with a deeper interest. We catch the sound
of what is to be paid—eight-pence, nine-pence, a shilling—and our
hopes generally rise with the postage. How we are provoked at the
delay in getting change—at the servant who does not hear the door!
Then if the postman passes, and we do not hear the expected knock,
what a pang is there! It is like the silence of death—of hope! We
think he does it on purpose, and enjoys all the misery of our
suspense. I have sometimes walked out to see the Mail-Coach pass,
by which I had sent a letter, or to meet it when I expected one.
I never see a Mail-Coach, for this reason, but I look at it as the
bearer of glad tidings—the messenger of fate. I have reason to say
so. The finest sight in the metropolis is that of the Mail-Coaches
setting off from Piccadilly. The horses paw the ground, and are
impatient to be gone, as if conscious of the precious burden they
convey. There is a peculiar secresy and despatch, significant and
full of meaning, in all the proceedings concerning them. Even the
outside passengers have an erect and supercilious air, as if proof
against the accidents of the journey. In fact, it seems indifferent
whether they are to encounter the summer’s heat or winter’s cold,
since they are borne on through the air in a winged chariot. The
Mail-Carts drive up; the transfer of packages is made; and, at a
signal given, they start off, bearing the irrevocable scrolls that give
wings to thought, and that bind or sever hearts for ever. How we
hate the Putney and Brentford stages that draw up in a line after
they are gone! Some persons think the sublimest object in nature is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>a ship launched on the bosom of the ocean: but give me, for my
private satisfaction, the Mail-Coaches that pour down Piccadilly of
an evening, tear up the pavement, and devour the way before them
to the Land’s-End!</p>

<p class='c007'>In Cowper’s time, Mail-Coaches were hardly set up; but he has
beautifully described the coming in of the Post-Boy:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Hark! ’tis the twanging horn o’er yonder bridge,</div>
      <div class='line'>That with its wearisome but needful length</div>
      <div class='line'>Bestrides the wintry flood, in which the moon</div>
      <div class='line'>Sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright:—</div>
      <div class='line'>He comes, the herald of a noisy world,</div>
      <div class='line'>With spattered boots, strapped waist, and frozen locks;</div>
      <div class='line'>News from all nations lumbering at his back.</div>
      <div class='line'>True to his charge, the close-packed load behind.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet careless what he brings, his one concern</div>
      <div class='line'>Is to conduct it to the destined inn;</div>
      <div class='line'>And having dropped the expected bag, pass on.</div>
      <div class='line'>He whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch!</div>
      <div class='line'>Cold and yet cheerful; messenger of grief</div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some;</div>
      <div class='line'>To him indifferent whether grief or joy.</div>
      <div class='line'>Houses in ashes and the fall of stocks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Births, deaths, and marriages, epistles wet</div>
      <div class='line'>With tears that trickled down the writer’s cheeks</div>
      <div class='line'>Fast as the periods from his fluent quill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or charged with amorous sighs of absent swains</div>
      <div class='line'>Or nymphs responsive, equally affect</div>
      <div class='line'>His horse and him, unconscious of them all.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And yet, notwithstanding this, and so many other passages that seem
like the very marrow of our being, Lord Byron denies that Cowper
was a poet!—The Mail-Coach is an improvement on the Post-Boy;
but I fear it will hardly bear so poetical a description. The picturesque
and dramatic do not keep pace with the useful and mechanical. The
telegraphs that lately communicated the intelligence of the new revolution
to all France within a few hours, are a wonderful contrivance;
but they are less striking and appalling than the beacon-fires (mentioned
by Æschylus), which, lighted from hill-top to hill-top,
announced the taking of Troy, and the return of Agamemnon.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘As for politics, I think poets are <em>Tories</em> by nature, supposing them to be by
nature poets. The love of an individual person or family, that has worn a crown
for many successions, is an inclination greatly adapted to the fanciful tribe. On
the other hand, mathematicians, abstract reasoners, of no manner of attachment to
persons, at least to the visible part of them, but prodigiously devoted to the ideas
of virtue, liberty, and so forth, are generally <em>Whigs</em>. It happens agreeably enough
to this maxim, that the Whigs are friends to that wise, plodding, unpoetical people,
the Dutch.’—<cite>Skenstone’s Letters</cite>, 1746.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Spirit of Monarchy then is nothing but the craving in the human
mind after the Sensible and the One. It is not so much a matter of
state-necessity or policy, as a natural infirmity, a disease, a false
appetite in the popular feeling, which must be gratified. Man is an
individual animal with narrow faculties, but infinite desires, which he
is anxious to concentrate in some one object within the grasp of his
imagination, and where, if he cannot be all that he wishes himself, he
may at least contemplate his own pride, vanity, and passions, displayed
in their most extravagant dimensions in a being no bigger and no better
than himself. Each individual would (were it in his power) be a
king, a God: but as he cannot, the next best thing is to see this
reflex image of his self-love, the darling passion of his breast, realized,
embodied out of himself in the first object he can lay his hands on
for the purpose. The slave admires the tyrant, because the last is,
what the first <em>would be</em>. He surveys himself all over in the glass of
royalty. The swelling, bloated self-importance of the one is the very
counterpart and ultimate goal of the abject servility of the other.
But both hate mankind for the same reason, because a respect for
humanity is a diversion to their inordinate self-love, and the idea of
the general good is a check to the gross intemperance of passion.
The worthlessness of the object does not diminish but irritate the
propensity to admire. It serves to pamper our imagination equally,
and does not provoke our envy. All we want is to aggrandize our
own vain-glory at second-hand; and the less of real superiority or
excellence there is in the person we fix upon as our proxy in this dramatic
exhibition, the more easily can we change places with him, and
fancy ourselves as good as he. Nay, the descent favours the rise;
and we heap our tribute of applause the higher, in proportion as it is
a free gift. An idol is not the worse for being of coarse materials:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>a king should be a common-place man. Otherwise, he is superior in
his own nature, and not dependent on our bounty or caprice. Man
is a poetical animal, and delights in fiction. We like to have scope
for the exercise of our mere will. We make kings of men, and
Gods of stocks and stones: we are not jealous of the creatures of our
own hands. We only want a peg or loop to hang our idle fancies on,
a puppet to dress up, a lay-figure to paint from. It is ‘<span class='sc'>Thing</span> Ferdinand,
and not <span class='sc'>King</span> Ferdinand,’ as it was wisely and wittily
observed. We ask only for the stage effect; we do not go behind
the scenes, or it would go hard with many of our prejudices! We
see the symbols of majesty, we enjoy the pomp, we crouch before the
power, we walk in the procession, and make part of the pageant, and
we say in our secret hearts, there is nothing but accident that prevents
us from being at the head of it. There is something in the mock-sublimity
of thrones, wonderfully congenial to the human mind.
Every man feels that he could sit there; every man feels that he
could look big there; every man feels that he could bow there;
every man feels that he could play the monarch there. The transition
is so easy, and so delightful! The imagination keeps pace with
royal state,</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The Madman in Hogarth who fancies himself a king, is not a solitary
instance of this species of hallucination. Almost every true and loyal
subject holds such a barren sceptre in his hand; and the meanest of
the rabble, as he runs by the monarch’s side, has wit enough to think—‘There
goes my <em>royal</em> self!’ From the most absolute despot to
the lowest slave there is but one step (no, not one) in point of real
merit. As far as truth or reason is concerned, they might change
situations to-morrow—nay, they constantly do so without the smallest
loss or benefit to mankind! Tyranny, in a word, is a farce got up
for the entertainment of poor human nature; and it might pass very
well, if it did not so often turn into a tragedy.</p>

<p class='c007'>We once heard a celebrated and elegant historian and a hearty
Whig declare, he liked a king like George <span class='fss'>III.</span> better than such a one
as Buonaparte; because, in the former case, there was nothing to
overawe the imagination but birth and situation; whereas he could
not so easily brook the double superiority of the other, mental as well
as adventitious. So does the spirit of independence and the levelling
pride of intellect join in with the servile rage of the vulgar! This
is the advantage which an hereditary has over an elective monarchy:
for there is no end of the dispute about precedence while merit is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>supposed to determine it, each man laying claim to this in his own
person; so that there is no other way to set aside all controversy and
heart-burnings, but by precluding moral and intellectual qualifications
altogether, and referring the choice to accident, and giving the preference
to a nonentity. ‘A good king,’ says Swift, ‘should be, in
all other respects, a mere cypher.’</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been remarked, as a peculiarity in modern criticism, that the
courtly and loyal make a point of crying up Mr. Young, as an actor,
and equally running down Mr. Kean; and it has been conjectured in
consequence that Mr. Kean was a <em>radical</em>. Truly, he is not a radical
politician; but what is as bad, he is a radical actor. He savours too
much of the reality. He is not a mock-tragedian, an automaton
player—he is something besides his paraphernalia. He has ‘that
within which passes shew.’ There is not a particle of affinity
between him and the patrons of the court-writers. Mr. Young, on the
contrary, is the very thing—all assumption and strut and measured
pomp, full of self-importance, void of truth and nature, the mask of
the characters he takes, a pasteboard figure, a stiff piece of wax-work.
He fills the throne of tragedy, not like an upstart or usurper, but as a
matter of course, decked out in his plumes of feathers, and robes of
state, stuck into a posture, and repeating certain words by rote. Mr.
Kean has a heart in his bosom, beating with human passion (a thing
for the great ‘to fear, not to delight in!’) he is a living man, and not
an artificial one. How should those, who look to the surface, and
never probe deeper, endure him? He is the antithesis of a court-actor.
It is the object there to suppress and varnish over the feelings,
not to give way to them. His <em>overt</em> manner must shock them, and
be thought a breach of all decorum. They are in dread of his fiery
humours, of coming near his Voltaic Battery—they chuse rather to
be roused gently from their self-complacent apathy by the application
of Metallic Tractors. They dare not trust their delicate nerves
within the estuary of the passions, but would slumber out their torpid
existence in a calm, a Dead Sea—the air of which extinguishes life
and motion!</p>

<p class='c007'>Would it not be hard upon a little girl, who is busy in dressing up
a favourite doll, to pull it in pieces before her face in order to shew
her the bits of wood, the wool, and rags it is composed of? So it
would be hard upon that great baby, the world, to take any of its
idols to pieces, and shew that they are nothing but painted wood.
Neither of them would thank you, but would consider the offer as an
insult. The little girl knows as well as you do that her doll is a
cheat; but she shut her eyes to it, for she finds her account in keeping
up the deception. Her doll is her pretty little self. In its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>glazed eyes, its cherry cheeks, its flaxen locks, its finery and its
baby-house, she has a fairy vision of her own future charms, her
future triumphs, a thousand hearts led captive, and an establishment
for life. Harmless illusion! that can create something out of nothing,
can make that which is good for nothing in itself so fine in appearance,
and clothe a shapeless piece of deal-board with the attributes of a
divinity! But the great world has been doing little else but playing
at <em>make-believe</em> all its lifetime. For several thousand years its chief
rage was to paint larger pieces of wood and smear them with gore and
call them Gods and offer victims to them—slaughtered hecatombs,
the fat of goats and oxen, or human sacrifices—shewing in this its
love of shew, of cruelty, and imposture; and woe to him who should
‘peep through the blanket of the dark to cry, <em>Hold, hold</em>.’—<em>Great is
Diana of the Ephesians</em>, was the answer in all ages. It was in vain to
represent to them, ‘Your Gods have eyes but they see not, ears but
they hear not, neither do they understand’—the more stupid, brutish,
helpless, and contemptible they were, the more furious, bigotted, and
implacable were their votaries in their behalf.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c008'><sup>[43]</sup></a> The more absurd
the fiction, the louder was the noise made to hide it—the more
mischievous its tendency, the more did it excite all the phrenzy of
the passions. Superstition nursed, with peculiar zeal, her ricketty,
deformed, and preposterous offspring. She passed by the nobler races
of animals even, to pay divine honours to the odious and unclean—she
took toads and serpents, cats, rats, dogs, crocodiles, goats and
monkeys, and hugged them to her bosom, and dandled them into
deities, and set up altars to them, and drenched the earth with tears
and blood in their defence; and those who did not believe in them
were cursed, and were forbidden the use of bread, of fire, and water,
and to worship them was piety, and their images were held sacred,
and their race became Gods in perpetuity and by divine right. To
touch them, was sacrilege: to kill them, death, even in your own
defence. If they stung you, you must die: if they infested the land
with their numbers and their pollutions, there was no remedy. The
nuisance was intolerable, impassive, immortal. Fear, religious horror,
disgust, hatred, heightened the flame of bigotry and intolerance.
There was nothing so odious or contemptible but it found a sanctuary
in the more odious and contemptible perversity of human nature.
The barbarous Gods of antiquity reigned <em>in contempt of their worshippers</em>!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>This game was carried on through all the first ages of the world,
and is still kept up in many parts of it; and it is impossible to describe
the wars, massacres, horrors, miseries and crimes, to which it gave
colour, sanctity, and sway. The idea of a God, beneficent and just,
the invisible maker of all things, was abhorrent to their gross, material
notions. No, they must have Gods of their own making, that
they could see and handle, that they knew to be nothing in themselves
but senseless images, and these they daubed over with the gaudy
emblems of their own pride and passions, and these they lauded to
the skies, and grew fierce, obscene, frantic before them, as the
representatives of their sordid ignorance and barbaric vices. <span class='sc'>Truth</span>,
<span class='sc'>Good</span>, were idle names to them, without a meaning. They must have
a lie, a palpable, pernicious lie, to pamper their crude, unhallowed
conceptions with, and to exercise the untameable fierceness of their
wills. The Jews were the only people of antiquity who were withheld
from running headlong into this abomination; yet so strong was
the propensity in them (from inherent frailty as well as neighbouring
example) that it could only be curbed and kept back by the hands of
Omnipotence.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c008'><sup>[44]</sup></a> At length, reason prevailed over imagination so far,
that these brute idols and their altars were overturned; it was thought
too much to set up stocks and stones, Golden Calves and Brazen
Serpents, as <i><span lang="la">bonâ-fide</span></i> Gods and Goddesses, which men were to fall
down and worship at their peril—and Pope long after summed up the
merits of the whole mythologic tribe in a handsome distich—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Gods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose attributes were rage, revenge, or lust.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was thought a bold stride to divert the course of our imaginations,
the overflowings of our enthusiasm, our love of the mighty and the
marvellous, from the dead to the living <em>subject</em>, and there we stick.
We have got living idols, instead of dead ones; and we fancy that
they are real, and put faith in them accordingly. Oh, Reason! when
will thy long minority expire? It is not now the fashion to make
Gods of wood and stone and brass, but we make kings of common
men, and are proud of our own handy-work. We take a child from
his birth, and we agree, when he grows up to be a man, to heap the
highest honours of the state upon him, and to pay the most devoted
homage to his will. Is there any thing in the person, ‘any mark,
any likelihood,’ to warrant this sovereign awe and dread? No: he
may be little better than an ideot, little short of a madman, and yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>he is no less qualified for king.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c008'><sup>[45]</sup></a> If he can contrive to pass the
College of Physicians, the Herald’s College dub him divine. Can
we make any given individual taller or stronger or wiser than other
men, or different in any respect from what nature intended him to be?
No; but we can make a king of him. We cannot add a cubit to the
stature, or instil a virtue into the minds of monarchs—but we can put
a sceptre into their hands, a crown upon their heads, we can set them
on an eminence, we can surround them with circumstance, we can
aggrandise them with power, we can pamper their appetites, we can
pander to their wills. We can do every thing to exalt them in
external rank and station—nothing to lift them one step higher in
the scale of moral or intellectual excellence. Education does not
give capacity or temper; and the education of kings is not especially
directed to useful knowledge or liberal sentiment. What then is the
state of the case? The highest respect of the community and of
every individual in it is paid and is due of right there, where perhaps
not an idea can take root, or a single virtue be engrafted. Is not this
to erect a standard of esteem directly opposite to that of mind and
morals? The lawful monarch may be the best or the worst man in
his dominions, he may be the wisest or the weakest, the wittiest or
the stupidest: still he is equally entitled to our homage as king, for
it is the place and power we bow to, and not the man. He may
be a sublimation of all the vices and diseases of the human heart; yet
we are not to say so, we dare not even think so. ‘Fear God, and
honour the King,’ is equally a maxim at all times and seasons. The
personal character of the king has nothing to do with the question.
Thus the extrinsic is set up over the intrinsic by authority: wealth
and interest lend their countenance to gilded vice and infamy on principle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>and outward shew and advantages become the symbols and the
standard of respect in despite of useful qualities or well-directed efforts
through all ranks and gradations of society. ‘From the crown of the
head to the sole of the foot there is no soundness left.’ The whole
style of moral thinking, feeling, acting, is in a false tone—is hollow,
spurious, meretricious. Virtue, says Montesquieu, is the principle of
republics; honour, of a monarchy. But it is ‘honour dishonourable,
sin-bred’—it is the honour of trucking a principle for a place, of
exchanging our honest convictions for a ribbon or a garter. The
business of life is a scramble for unmerited precedence. Is not the
highest respect entailed, the highest station filled without any possible
proofs or pretensions to public spirit or public principle? Shall not
the next places to it be secured by the sacrifice of them? It is the
order of the day, the understood etiquette of courts and kingdoms.
For the servants of the crown to presume on merit, when the crown
itself is held as an heir-loom by prescription, is a kind of <em>lèse majesté</em>,
an indirect attainder of the title to the succession. Are not all eyes
turned to the sun of court-favour? Who would not then reflect its
smile by the performance of any acts which can avail in the eye of
the great, and by the surrender of any virtue, which attracts neither
notice nor applause? The stream of corruption begins at the fountainhead
of court influence. The sympathy of mankind is that on which
all strong feeling and opinion floats; and this sets in full in every
absolute monarchy to the side of tinsel shew and iron-handed power,
in contempt and defiance of right and wrong. The right and the
wrong are of little consequence, compared to the <em>in</em> and the <em>out</em>.
The distinction between Whig and Tory is merely nominal: neither
have their country one bit at heart. Phaw! we had forgot—Our
British monarchy is a mixed, and the only perfect form of government;
and therefore what is here said cannot properly apply to it.
But <span class='sc'>Might before Right</span> is the motto blazoned on the front of unimpaired
and undivided Sovereignty!—</p>

<p class='c007'>A court is the centre of fashion; and no less so, for being the sink
of luxury and vice—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘Of outward shew</div>
      <div class='line'>Elaborate, of inward less exact.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The goods of fortune, the baits of power, the indulgences of vanity,
may be accumulated without end, and the taste for them increases as
it is gratified: the love of virtue, the pursuit of truth, grow stale and
dull in the dissipation of a court. Virtue is thought crabbed and
morose, knowledge pedantic, while every sense is pampered, and
every folly tolerated. Every thing tends naturally to personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>aggrandisement and unrestrained self-will. It is easier for monarchs
as well as other men ‘to tread the primrose path of dalliance’ than
‘to scale the steep and thorny road to heaven.’ The vices, when they
have leave from power and authority, go greater lengths than the
virtues; example justifies almost every excess, and ‘nice customs
curtsey to great kings.’ What chance is there that monarchs should
not yield to the temptations of gallantry there, where youth and
beauty are as wax? What female heart can indeed withstand the
attractions of a throne—the smile that melts all hearts, the air that
awes rebellion, the frown that kings dread, the hand that scatters
fairy wealth, that bestows titles, places, honour, power, the breast on
which the star glitters, the head circled with a diadem, whose dress
dazzles with its richness and its taste, who has nations at his command,
senates at his controul, ‘in form and motion so express and
admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a
God; the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals!’ The power
of resistance is so much the less, where fashion extends impunity to
the frail offender, and screens the loss of character.</p>

      <div class='line'>‘Vice is undone, if she forgets her birth,</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>The air of a court is not assuredly that which is most favourable
to the practice of self-denial and strict morality. We increase the
temptations of wealth, of power, and pleasure a thousand-fold, while
we can give no additional force to the antagonist principles of reason,
disinterested integrity and goodness of heart. Is it to be wondered
at that courts and palaces have produced so many monsters of avarice,
cruelty, and lust? The adept in voluptuousness is not likely to be a
proportionable proficient in humanity. To feed on plate or be clothed
in purple, is not to feel for the hungry and the naked. He who has
the greatest power put into his hands, will only become more impatient
of any restraint in the use of it. To have the welfare and the
lives of millions placed at our disposal, is a sort of warrant, a challenge
to squander them without mercy. An arbitrary monarch set over the
heads of his fellows does not identify himself with them, or learn to
comprehend their rights or sympathise with their interests, but looks
down upon them as of a different species from himself, as insects
crawling on the face of the earth, that he may trample on at his
pleasure, or if he spares them, it is an act of royal grace—he is besotted
with power, blinded with prerogative, an alien to his nature, a traitor
to his trust, and instead of being the organ of public feeling and
public opinion, is an excrescence and an anomaly in the state, a
bloated mass of morbid humours and proud flesh! A constitutional
king, on the other hand, is a servant of the public, a representative
of the people’s wants and wishes, dispensing justice and mercy according
to law. Such a monarch is the King of England! Such was
his late, and such is his present Majesty George the <span class='fss'>IV</span>th!—</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us take the Spirit of Monarchy in its highest state of exaltation,
in the moment of its proudest triumph—a Coronation-day. We
now see it in our mind’s eye; the preparation of weeks—the expectation
of months—the seats, the privileged places, are occupied in the
obscurity of night, and in silence—the day dawns slowly, big with
the hope of Cæsar and of Rome—the golden censers are set in order,
the tables groan with splendour and with luxury—within the inner
space the rows of peeresses are set, and revealed to the eye decked
out in ostrich feathers and pearls, like beds of lilies sparkling with a
thousand dew-drops—the marshals and the heralds are in motion—the
full organ, majestic, peals forth the Coronation Anthem—every
thing is ready—and all at once the Majesty of kingdoms bursts upon
the astonished sight—his person is swelled out with all the gorgeousness
of dress, and swathed in bales of silk and golden tissues—the
bow with which he greets the assembled multitude, and the representatives
of foreign kings, is the climax of conscious dignity, bending
gracefully on its own bosom, and instantly thrown back into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>sightless air, as if asking no recognition in return—the oath of mutual
fealty between him and his people is taken—the fairest flowers of
female beauty precede the Sovereign, scattering roses; the sons of
princes page his heels, holding up the robes of crimson and ermine—he
staggers and reels under the weight of royal pomp, and of a nation’s
eyes; and thus the pageant is launched into the open day, dazzling
the sun, whose beams seem beaten back by the sun of royalty—there
were the warrior, the statesman, and the mitred head—there was
Prince Leopold, like a panther in its dark glossy pride, and Castlereagh,
clad in triumphant smiles and snowy satin, unstained with his
own blood—the loud trumpet brays, the cannon roars, the spires are
mad with music, the stones in the street are startled at the presence of
a king:—the crowd press on, the metropolis heaves like a sea in restless
motion, the air is thick with loyalty’s quick pants in its monarch’s
arms—all eyes drink up the sight, all tongues reverberate the sound—</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>What does it all amount to? A shew—a theatrical spectacle!
What does it prove? That a king is crowned, that a king is
dead! What is the moral to be drawn from it, that is likely to
sink into the heart of a nation? That greatness consists in finery,
and that supreme merit is the dower of birth and fortune! It is a
form, a ceremony to which each successor to the throne is entitled in
his turn as a matter of right. Does it depend on the inheritance of
virtue, on the acquisition of knowledge in the new monarch, whether
he shall be thus exalted in the eyes of the people? No;—to say so
is not only an offence in manners, but a violation of the laws. The
king reigns in contempt of any such pragmatical distinctions. They
are set aside, proscribed, treasonable, as it relates to the august person
of the monarch; what is likely to become of them in the minds of
the people? A Coronation overlays and drowns all such considerations
for a generation to come, and so far it serves its purpose well.
It debauches the understandings of the people, and makes them the
slaves of sense and show. It laughs to scorn and tramples upon every
other claim to distinction or respect. Is the chief person in the
pageant a tyrant? It does not lessen, but aggrandise him to the
imagination. Is he the king of a free people? We make up in love
and loyalty what we want in fear. Is he young? He borrows
understanding and experience from the learning and tried wisdom of
councils and parliaments. Is he old? He leans upon the youth and
beauty that attend his triumph. Is he weak? Armies support him
with their myriads. Is he diseased? What is health to a staff of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>physicians? Does he die? The truth is out, and he is then—nothing!</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a cant among court-sycophants of calling all those who
are opposed to them, ‘the <em>rabble</em>,’ ‘<em>fellows</em>,’ ‘<em>miscreants</em>,’ &#38;c. This
shews the grossness of their ideas of all true merit, and the false
standard of rank and power by which they measure every thing; like
footmen, who suppose their masters must be gentlemen, and that the
rest of the world are low people. Whatever is opposed to power,
they think despicable; whatever suffers oppression, they think
deserves it. They are ever ready to side with the strong, to insult
and trample on the weak. This is with us a pitiful fashion of thinking.
They are not of the mind of Pope, who was so full of the
opposite conviction, that he has even written a bad couplet to express
it:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow:</div>
      <div class='line'>The rest is all but leather and prunella.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Those lines in Cowper also must sound very puerile or old-fashioned
to courtly ears:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The only amaranthine flower on earth</div>
      <div class='line'>Is virtue; the only lasting treasure, truth.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>To this sentiment, however, we subscribe our hearts and hands.
There is nothing truly liberal but that which postpones its own claims
to those of propriety—or great, but that which looks out of itself to
others. All power is but an unabated nuisance, a barbarous assumption,
an aggravated injustice, that is not directed to the common good:
all grandeur that has not something corresponding to it in personal
merit and heroic acts, is a deliberate burlesque, and an insult on
common sense and human nature. That which is true, the understanding
ratifies: that which is good, the heart owns: all other
claims are spurious, vitiated, mischevious, false—fit only for those
who are sunk below contempt, or raised above opinion. We hold in
scorn all <em>right-lined</em> pretensions but those of rectitude. If there is
offence in this, we are ready to abide by it. If there is shame, we
take it to ourselves: and we hope and hold that the time will come,
when all other idols but those which represent pure truth and real
good, will be looked upon with the same feelings of pity and wonder
that we now look back to the images of Thor and Woden!</p>

<p class='c007'>Really, that men born to a throne (limited or unlimited) should
employ the brief span of their existence here in doing all the mischief
in their power, in levying cruel wars and undermining the liberties of
the world, to prove to themselves and others that their pride and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>passions are of more consequence than the welfare of mankind at
large, would seem a little astonishing, but that the fact is so. It is
not our business to preach lectures to monarchs, but if we were at all
disposed to attempt the ungracious task, we should do it in the words
of an author who often addressed the ear of monarchs.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘A man may read a sermon,’ says Jeremy Taylor, ‘the best and
most passionate that ever man preached, if he shall but enter into the
sepulchres of kings. In the same Escurial where the Spanish princes
live in greatness and power, and decree war or peace, they have wisely
placed a cemetery where their ashes and their glory shall sleep till
time shall be no more: and where <em>our</em> kings have been crowned,
their ancestors lie interred, and they must walk over their grandsire’s
head to take his crown. There is an acre sown with royal seed, the
copy of the greatest change from rich to naked, from ceiled roofs to
arched coffins, from living like Gods to die like men. There is
enough to cool the flames of lust, to abate the height of pride, to
appease the itch of covetous desires, to sully and dash out the dissembling
colours of a lustful, artificial, and imaginary beauty. There
the warlike and the peaceful, the fortunate and the miserable, the
beloved and the despised princes mingle their dust, and pay down
their symbol of mortality, and tell all the world, that when we die
our ashes shall be equal to kings, and our accounts shall be easier,
and our pains for our crimes shall be less. To my apprehension, it is
a sad record which is left by Athenæus concerning Ninus, the great
Assyrian monarch, whose life and death is summed up in these words:
“Ninus, the Assyrian, had an ocean of gold, and other riches more
than the sand in the Caspian sea; he never saw the stars, and perhaps
he never desired it; he never stirred up the holy fire among the Magi;
nor touched his God with the sacred rod, according to the laws; he
never offered sacrifice, nor worshipped the Deity, nor administered
justice, nor spake to the people, nor numbered them; but he was most
valiant to eat and drink, and having mingled his wines, he threw the
rest upon the stones. This man is dead: behold his sepulchre, and
now hear where Ninus is. <em>Sometime I was Ninus, and drew the
breath of a living man, but now am nothing but clay. I have nothing
but what I did eat, and what I served to myself in lust is all my
portion: the wealth with which I was blest, my enemies meeting together
shall carry away, as the mad Thyades carry a raw goat. I am gone
to Hell; and when I went thither, I carried neither gold nor horse, nor
a silver chariot. I that wore a mitre, am now a little heap of dust!</em>”‘—Taylor’s
Holy Living and Dying.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Scotch nation are a body-corporate. They hang together like
a swarm of bees. I do not know how it may be among themselves,
but with us they are all united as one man. They are not straggling
individuals, but embodied, formidable abstractions—determined personifications
of the land they come from. A Scotchman gets on in
the world, because he is not one, but many. He moves in himself
a host, drawn up in battle-array, and armed at all points against all
impugners. He is a double existence—he stands for himself and his
country. Every Scotchman is bond and surety for every other
Scotchman—he thinks nothing Scotch foreign to him. If you see a
Scotchman in the street, you may be almost sure it is another Scotchman
he is arm in arm with; and what is more, you may be sure they
are talking of Scotchmen. Begin at the Arctic Circle, and they take
Scotland in their way back. Plant the foot of the compasses in the
meridian, and they turn it by degrees to ‘Edina’s darling seat’—true
as the needle to the Pole. If you happen to say it is a high
wind, they say there are high winds in Edinburgh. Should you
mention Hampstead or Highgate, they smile at this as a local prejudice,
and remind you of the Calton Hill. The conversation wanders
and is impertinent, unless it hangs by this loop. It ‘runs the great
mile, and is still at home.’ You would think there was no other
place in the world but Scotland, but that they strive to convince you
at every turn of its superiority to all other places. Nothing goes
down but Scotch Magazines and Reviews, Scotch airs, Scotch bravery,
Scotch hospitality, Scotch novels, and Scotch logic. Some one the
other day at a literary dinner in Scotland apologised for alluding to the
name of Shakespear so often, because he was not a Scotchman.
What a blessing that the Duke of Wellington was not a Scotchman, or
we should never have heard the last of him! Even Sir Walter
Scott, I understand, talks of the Scotch novels in all companies; and
by waving the title of the author, is at liberty to repeat the subject <em>ad
infinitum</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lismahago in Smollett is a striking and laughable picture of this
national propensity. He maintained with good discretion and method
that oat-cakes were better than wheaten bread, and that the air of the
old town of Edinburgh was sweet and salubrious. He was a favourable
specimen of the class—acute though pertinacious, pleasant but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>wrong.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c008'><sup>[47]</sup></a> In general, his countrymen only plod on with the national
character fastened behind them, looking round with wary eye and
warning voice to those who would pick out a single article of their
precious charge; and are as drawling and troublesome as if they
were hired by the hour to disclaim and exemplify all the vices of which
they stand accused. Is this repulsive egotism peculiar to them merely
in their travelling capacity, when they have to make their way
amongst strangers, and are jealous of the honour of the parent-country,
on which they have ungraciously turned their backs? So Lord
Erskine, after an absence of fifty years, made an appropriate eulogy
on the place of his birth, and having traced the feeling of patriotism
in himself to its source in that habitual attachment which all wandering
tribes have to their places of fixed residence, turned his horses’ heads
towards England—and farewell sentiment!</p>

<p class='c007'>The Irish and others, who come and stay among us, however full
they may be of the same prejudice, keep it in a great measure to
themselves, and do not vent it in all companies and on all occasions,
proper or improper. The natives of the sister-kingdom in particular
rather cut their country like a poor relation, are shy of being seen in
one another’s company, and try to soften down the <em>brogue</em> into a
natural gentility of expression. A Scotchman, on the contrary, is
never easy but when his favourite subject is started, treats it with
unqualified breadth of accent, and seems assured that every one else
must be as fond of talking of Scotland and Scotchmen as he is.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it a relic of the ancient system of <em>clanship</em>? And are the Scotch
pitted against all the rest of the world, on the same principle that they
formerly herded and banded together under some chosen leader, and
<em>harried</em> the neighbouring district? This seems to be the most likely
solution. A feeling of antipathy and partisanship, of offensive and
defensive warfare, may be considered as necessary to the mind of a
Scotchman. He is nothing in himself but as he is opposed to or in
league with others. He must be for or against somebody. He must
have a cause to fight for; a point to carry in argument. He is not
an unit but an aggregate; he is not a link, but a chain. He belongs
to the regiment. I should hardly call a Scotchman <em>conceited</em>, though
there is often something that borders strongly on the appearance of it.
He has (speaking in the lump) no personal or individual pretensions.
He is not proud of himself, but of being a Scotchman. He has no
existence or excellence except what he derives from some external
accident, or shares with some body of men. He is a Brunonian, a
Cameronian, a Jacobite, a Covenanter; he is of some party, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>espouses some creed, he is great in some controversy, he was bred in
some University, has attended a certain course of lectures, understands
Gaelic, and upon occasion wears the Highland dress. An Englishman
is satisfied with the character of his country, and proceeds to set
up for himself; an Irishman despairs of that of his, and leaves it to
shift for itself; a Scotchman pretends to respectability as such, and
owes it to his country to make you hate the very name by his ceaseless
importunity and intolerance in its behalf. An Irishman is mostly
vain of his person, an Englishman of his understanding, a Frenchman
of his politeness—a Scotchman thanks God for the place of his birth.
The face of a Scotchman is to him accordingly the face of a friend.
It is enough for him to let you know that he speaks the dialect that
Wilkie speaks, that he has sat in company with the Author of
Waverley. He does not endeavour to put forward his own notions
so much as to inform you of the school in politics, in morals, in
physic, in which he is an adept; nor does he attempt to overpower
you by wit, by reason, by eloquence, but to tire you out by dint of
verbal logic; and in common-places it must be confessed that he is
invincible. There he is <em>teres et rotundus</em>. He fortifies himself in
these, circumvallation within circumvallation, till his strong-hold is
impregnable by art and nature. I never knew a Scotchman give up
an argument but once. It was a very learned man, the Editor of
an Encyclopedia,—not my friend, Mr. Macvey Napier. On some
one’s proposing the question why Greek should not be printed in the
Roman type, this gentleman answered, that in that case it would be
impossible to distinguish the two languages. Every one stared, and
it was asked how at this rate we distinguished French from English?
It was the forlorn hope. Any one else would have laughed, and
confessed the blunder. But the Editor was a grave man—made an
obstinate defence (the best his situation allowed of) and yielded in
the forms and with the honours of war.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Scotchman is generally a dealer in staple-propositions, and not in
rarities and curiosities of the understanding. He does not like an idea
the worse for its coming to him from a reputable, well-authenticated
source, as I conceive he might feel more respect for a son of Burns
than for Burns himself, on the same hereditary or genealogical
principle. He swears (of course) by the Edinburgh Review, and
thinks Blackwood not easily put down. He takes the word of a
Professor in the University-chair in a point of philosophy as he
formerly took the Laird’s word in a matter of life and death; and
has the names of the Says, the Benthams, the Mills, the Malthuses, in
his mouth, instead of the Montroses, the Gordons, and the Macullamores.
He follows in a train; he enlists under some standard; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>comes under some collateral description. He is of the tribe of
Issachar, and not of Judah. He stickles for no higher distinction
than that of his clan, or vicinage.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c008'><sup>[48]</sup></a> In a word, the Scotch are the
creatures of inveterate habit. They pin their faith on example and
authority. All their ideas are cast in a previous mould, and rivetted
to those of others. It is not a single blow, but a repetition of blows,
that leaves an impression on them. They are strong only in the
strength of prejudice and numbers. The genius of their greatest
living writer is the genius of national tradition. He has ‘damnable
iteration in him’; but hardly one grain of sheer invention. His
mind is turned instinctively backward on the past—he cannot project
it forward to the future. He has not the faculty of imagining any
thing, either in individual or general truth, different from what has
been handed down to him for such. Give him <em>costume</em>, dialect,
manners, popular superstitions, grotesque characters, supernatural
events, and local scenery, and he is a prodigy, a man-monster among
writers—take these actually embodied and endless materials from
him, and he is a common man, with as little original power of mind
as he has (unfortunately) independence or boldness of spirit!</p>

<p class='c007'>The Scotch, with all their mechanical, wholesale attachment to
names and parties, are venal in politics,<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c008'><sup>[49]</sup></a> and cowardly in friendship.
They crouch to power; and would be more disposed to fall upon and
crush, than come forward to the support of, a sinking individual.
They are not like La Fleur in the Sentimental Journey, who advanced
three steps forward to his master when the <em>Gens-d’ Armes</em> arrested
him: they are like the <em>Maitre d’ Hotel</em>, who retired three paces backwards
on the same occasion. They will support a generic denomination,
where they have numbers to support them again: they make
a great gulp, and swallow down a feudal lord with all the retinue he
can muster—<em>the more, the merrier</em>—but of a single unprotected straggler
they are shy, jealous, scrupulous in the extreme as to character, inquisitive
as to connections, curious in all the particulars of birth,
parentage and education. Setting his prejudices of country, religion,
or party aside, you have no hold of a Scotchman but by his self-interest.
If it is for his credit or advantage to stand by you, he will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>do it: otherwise, it will go very much against both his stomach and
his conscience to do so, and you must e’en shift for yourself. You
may trust something to the generosity and magnanimity of an Englishman
or an Irishman; they act from an impulse of the blood or from
a sense of justice: A Scotchman (the exceptions are splendid indeed)
uniformly calculates the consequences to himself. He is naturally
faithful to a leader, as I said before, that is, to a powerful head;
but his fidelity amounts to little more than servility. He is a bigot
to the shadow of power and authority, a slave to prejudice and
custom, and a coward in every thing else. He has not a particle of
mental courage. Cæsar’s wife was not to be suspected; and it is the
same with a Scotchman’s friend. If a word is said against your
moral character, they shun you like a plague-spot. They are not
only afraid of a charge being proved against you, but they dare not
disprove it, lest by clearing you of it they should be supposed a party
to what had no existence or foundation. They thus imbibe a bad
opinion of you from hearsay, and conceal the good they know of you
both from themselves and the world. If your political orthodoxy is
called in question, they take the alarm as much as if they were apprehensive
of being involved in a charge of high treason. One would
think that the whole country laboured, as they did <span class='sc'>Sixty Years Since</span>,
under an imputation of disaffection, and were exposed to the utmost
vigilance of the police, so that each person had too little character for
loyalty himself to run any additional risk by his neighbour’s bad
name. This is not the case at present: but they carry their precautions
and circumspection in this respect to such an idle and stupid
excess, as can only be accounted for from local circumstances and
history—that is to say, from the effects of that long system of suspicion,
persecution and <em>surveillance</em>, to which they were exposed during a
century of ridiculous (at least of unsuccessful) wars and rebellions, in
favour of the House of Stuart. They suffered much for King James
and the <em>Good Cause</em>; but since that time their self-love must be excused
to look at home. On my once complaining to a Scotchman of what
I thought a dereliction of his client’s cause by the counsel for the
defendant in a prosecution for libel, I received for answer—That
‘Mr. —— had defended the accused as far as he could, <em>consistently
with his character</em>,’—though the only character the Learned Gentleman
could boast, had been acquired by his skill, if not his courage, in
resisting prosecutions of this kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The delicate sensibility (not to say soreness) of the Scotch in
matters of moral reputation, may in like manner be accounted for
(indirectly) from their domiciliary system of church-government, of
Kirk-assemblies, and Ruling Elders: and in the unprincipled assurance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>with which aspersions of this sort are thrown out, and the panic-terror
which they strike into the timid or hypocritical, one may see the
remaining effects of Penance-Sheets and Cutty-Stools! Poor Burns!
he called up the ghost of Dr. Hornbook, but did not lay the spirit
of cant and lying in the Cunning North!</p>

<p class='c007'>Something however, it must be confessed, has been done; a change
has been effected. Extremes meet; and the Saint has been (in some
instances) merged in the Sinner. The essential character of the
Scotch is determined self-will, the driving at a purpose; so that
whatever they undertake, they make thorough-stitch work, and carry
as far as it will go. This is the case in the pretensions some of their
writers have lately set up to a contempt for Cutty-Stools, and to all
the freedom of wit and humour. They have been so long under
interdict that they break out with double violence, and stop at nothing.
Of all <em>blackguards</em> (I use the term for want of any other) a Scotch
blackguard is for this reason the worst. First, the character sits ill
upon him for want of use, and is sure to be most outrageously caricatured.
He is only just broke loose from the shackles of regularity
and restraint, and is forced to play strange antics to be convinced that
they are not still clinging to his heels. Secondly, formality, hypocrisy,
and a deference to opinion, are the ‘sins that most easily beset him.’
When therefore he has once made up his mind to disregard appearances,
he becomes totally reckless of character, and ‘at one bound
high overleaps all bound’ of decency and common sense. Again, there
is perhaps a natural hardness and want of nervous sensibility about the
Scotch, which renders them (rules and the consideration of consequences
apart) not very nice or scrupulous in their proceedings. If
they are not withheld by conscience or prudence, they have no
<em>mauvaise honte</em>, no involuntary qualms or tremors, to qualify their
effrontery and disregard of principle. Their impudence is extreme,
their malice is cold-blooded, covert, crawling, deliberate, without the
frailty or excuse of passion. They club their vices and their venality
together, and by the help of both together are invincible. The choice
spirits who have lately figured in a much-talked-of publication, with
‘old Sylvanus at their head,’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Leaning on cypress stadle stout,’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>in their ‘pious orgies’ resemble a troop of Yahoos, or a herd of
Satyrs—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And with their horned feet they beat the ground!’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>that is to say, the floor of Mr. Blackwood’s shop! There is one
other publication, a match for this in flagrant impudence and dauntless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>dulness, which is the John Bull. The Editor is supposed, for the
honour of Scotland, to be an Irishman. What the <cite>Beacon</cite> might
have proved, there is no saying; but it would have been curious to
have seen some articles of Sir Walter’s undoubted hand proceeding
from this quarter, as it has been always contended that Blackwood’s
Edinburgh Magazine was too low and scurrilous a publication for
him to have any share in it. The adventure of the <cite>Beacon</cite> has
perhaps discovered to Sir Walter’s admirers and the friends of
humanity in general, that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Entire affection scorneth nicer hands!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Old Dr. Burney, about the middle of the last century, called one
morning on Thomson, the Author of The Seasons, at a late hour, and
on expressing his surprise at the poet’s not having risen sooner,
received for answer,—‘I had no motive, young man!’ A Scotchman
acts always from a motive, and on due consideration; and if he
does not act right or with a view to honest ends, is more dangerous
than any one else. Others may plead the vices of their blood in extenuation
of their errors; but a Scotchman is a machine, and should
be constructed on sound moral, and philosophical principles, or should
be put a stop to altogether.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Liberal.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[1823.</span></p>

<p class='c006'>My father was a Dissenting Minister at W——m in Shropshire;
and in the year 1798 (the figures that compose that date are to me
like the ‘dreaded name of Demogorgon’) Mr. Coleridge came to
Shrewsbury, to succeed Mr. Rowe in the spiritual charge of a
Unitarian Congregation there. He did not come till late on the
Saturday afternoon before he was to preach; and Mr. Rowe, who
himself went down to the coach in a state of anxiety and expectation,
to look for the arrival of his successor, could find no one at all
answering the description but a round-faced man in a short black coat
(like a shooting jacket) which hardly seemed to have been made for
him, but who seemed to be talking at a great rate to his fellow-passengers.
Mr. Rowe had scarce returned to give an account of his
disappointment, when the round-faced man in black entered, and
dissipated all doubts on the subject, by beginning to talk. He did
not cease while he staid; nor has he since, that I know of. He
held the good town of Shrewsbury in delightful suspense for three
weeks that he remained there, ‘fluttering the <em>proud Salopians</em> like an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>eagle in a dove-cote; ‘and the Welch mountains that skirt the horizon
with their tempestuous confusion, agree to have heard no such mystic
sounds since the days of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘High-born Hoel’s harp or soft Llewellyn’s lay!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>As we passed along between W——m and Shrewsbury, and I eyed
their blue tops seen through the wintry branches, or the red rustling
leaves of the sturdy oak-trees by the road-side, a sound was in my
ears as of a Siren’s song; I was stunned, startled with it, as from
deep sleep; but I had no notion then that I should ever be able to
express my admiration to others in motley imagery or quaint allusion,
till the light of his genius shone into my soul, like the sun’s rays
glittering in the puddles of the road. I was at that time dumb,
inarticulate, helpless, like a worm by the way-side, crushed, bleeding,
lifeless; but now, bursting from the deadly bands that ‘bound them,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘With Styx nine times round them,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>my ideas float on winged words, and as they expand their plumes,
catch the golden light of other years. My soul has indeed remained
in its original bondage, dark, obscure, with longings infinite and
unsatisfied; my heart, shut up in the prison-house of this rude clay,
has never found, nor will it ever find, a heart to speak to; but that
my understanding also did not remain dumb and brutish, or at length
found a language to express itself, I owe to Coleridge. But this is
not to my purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>My father lived ten miles from Shrewsbury, and was in the habit
of exchanging visits with Mr. Rowe, and with Mr. Jenkins of Whitchurch
(nine miles farther on) according to the custom of Dissenting
Ministers in each other’s neighbourhood. A line of communication
is thus established, by which the flame of civil and religious liberty is
kept alive, and nourishes its smouldering fire unquenchable, like the
fires in the Agamemnon of Æschylus, placed at different stations, that
waited for ten long years to announce with their blazing pyramids the
destruction of Troy. Coleridge had agreed to come over to see my
father, according to the courtesy of the country, as Mr. Rowe’s
probable successor; but in the meantime I had gone to hear him
preach the Sunday after his arrival. A poet and a philosopher
getting up into a Unitarian pulpit to preach the Gospel, was a romance
in these degenerate days, a sort of revival of the primitive spirit of
Christianity, which was not to be resisted.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in January, 1798, that I rose one morning before daylight,
to walk ten miles in the mud, and went to hear this celebrated person
preach. Never, the longest day I have to live, shall I have such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>another walk as this cold, raw, comfortless one, in the winter of the
year 1798. <i><span lang="fr">Il y a des impressions que ni le tems ni les circonstances
peuvent effacer. Dusse-je vivre des siècles entiers, le doux tems de ma
jeunesse ne peut renaître pour moi, ni s’effacer jamais dans ma mémoire.</span></i>
When I got there, the organ was playing the 100th psalm, and,
when it was done, Mr. Coleridge rose and gave out his text, ‘And
he went up into the mountain to pray, <span class='fss'>HIMSELF, ALONE</span>.’ As he gave
out this text, his voice ‘rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes,’
and when he came to the two last words, which he pronounced loud,
deep, and distinct, it seemed to me, who was then young, as if the
sounds had echoed from the bottom of the human heart, and as if that
prayer might have floated in solemn silence through the universe.
The idea of St. John came into mind, ‘of one crying in the wilderness,
who had his loins girt about, and whose food was locusts and
wild honey.’ The preacher then launched into his subject, like an
eagle dallying with the wind. The sermon was upon peace and war;
upon church and state—not their alliance, but their separation—on
the spirit of the world and the spirit of Christianity, not as the same,
but as opposed to one another. He talked of those who had
‘inscribed the cross of Christ on banners dripping with human gore.’
He made a poetical and pastoral excursion,—and to shew the fatal
effects of war, drew a striking contrast between the simple shepherd-boy,
driving his team afield, or sitting under the hawthorn, piping to
his flock, ‘as though he should never be old,’ and the same poor
country lad, crimped, kidnapped, brought into town, made drunk at
an alehouse, turned into a wretched drummer-boy, with his hair
sticking on end with powder and pomatum, a long cue at his back, and
tricked out in the loathsome finery of the profession of blood.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Such were the notes our once-lov’d poet sung.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And for myself, I could not have been more delighted if I had heard
the music of the spheres. Poetry and Philosophy had met together.
Truth and Genius had embraced, under the eye and with the sanction
of Religion. This was even beyond my hopes. I returned home well
satisfied. The sun that was still labouring pale and wan through the
sky, obscured by thick mists, seemed an emblem of the <em>good cause</em>;
and the cold dank drops of dew that hung half melted on the beard
of the thistle, had something genial and refreshing in them; for there
was a spirit of hope and youth in all nature, that turned every thing
into good. The face of nature had not then the brand of <span class='sc'>Jus
Divinum</span> on it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like to that sanguine flower inscrib’d with woe.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>On the Tuesday following, the half-inspired speaker came. I was
called down into the room where he was, and went half-hoping,
half-afraid. He received me very graciously, and I listened for a
long time without uttering a word. I did not suffer in his opinion by
my silence. ‘For those two hours,’ he afterwards was pleased to
say, ‘he was conversing with W. H.’s forehead! ‘His appearance
was different from what I had anticipated from seeing him before.
At a distance, and in the dim light of the chapel, there was to me a
strange wildness in his aspect, a dusky obscurity, and I thought him
pitted with the small-pox. His complexion was at that time clear,
and even bright—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘As are the children of yon azure sheen.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>His forehead was broad and high, light as if built of ivory, with large
projecting eyebrows, and his eyes rolling beneath them like a sea
with darkened lustre. ‘A certain tender bloom his face o’erspread,’
a purple tinge as we see it in the pale thoughtful complexions of the
Spanish portrait-painters, Murillo and Velasquez. His mouth was
gross, voluptuous, open, eloquent; his chin good-humoured and round;
but his nose, the rudder of the face, the index of the will, was small,
feeble, nothing—like what he has done. It might seem that the
genius of his face as from a height surveyed and projected him (with
sufficient capacity and huge aspiration) into the world unknown of
thought and imagination, with nothing to support or guide his veering
purpose, as if Columbus had launched his adventurous course for the
New World in a scallop, without oars or compass. So at least I
comment on it after the event. Coleridge in his person was rather
above the common size, inclining to the corpulent, or like Lord
Hamlet, ‘somewhat fat and pursy.’ His hair (now, alas! grey)
was then black and glossy as the raven’s, and fell in smooth masses
over his forehead. This long pendulous hair is peculiar to enthusiasts,
to those whose minds tend heavenward; and is traditionally inseparable
(though of a different colour) from the pictures of Christ. It
ought to belong, as a character, to all who preach <em>Christ crucified</em>, and
Coleridge was at that time one of those!</p>

<p class='c007'>It was curious to observe the contrast between him and my father,
who was a veteran in the cause, and then declining into the vale of
years. He had been a poor Irish lad, carefully brought up by his
parents, and sent to the University of Glasgow (where he studied
under Adam Smith) to prepare him for his future destination. It
was his mother’s proudest wish to see her son a Dissenting Minister.
So if we look back to past generations (as far as eye can reach) we
see the same hopes, fears, wishes, followed by the same disappointments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>throbbing in the human heart; and so we may see them (if we
look forward) rising up for ever, and disappearing, like vapourish
bubbles, in the human breast! After being tossed about from congregation
to congregation in the heats of the Unitarian controversy, and
squabbles about the American war, he had been relegated to an
obscure village, where he was to spend the last thirty years of his
life, far from the only converse that he loved, the talk about disputed
texts of Scripture and the cause of civil and religious liberty. Here
he passed his days, repining but resigned, in the study of the Bible,
and the perusal of the Commentators,—huge folios, not easily got
through, one of which would outlast a winter! Why did he pore on
these from morn to night (with the exception of a walk in the fields
or a turn in the garden to gather broccoli-plants or kidney-beans of
his own rearing, with no small degree of pride and pleasure)?—Here
were ‘no figures nor no fantasies,’—neither poetry nor philosophy—nothing
to dazzle, nothing to excite modern curiosity; but to his
lack-lustre eyes there appeared, within the pages of the ponderous,
unwieldy, neglected tomes, the sacred name of JEHOVAH in
Hebrew capitals: pressed down by the weight of the style, worn to
the last fading thinness of the understanding, there were glimpses,
glimmering notions of the patriarchal wanderings, with palm-trees
hovering in the horizon, and processions of camels at the distance of
three thousand years; there was Moses with the Burning Bush, the
number of the Twelve Tribes, types, shadows, glosses on the law and
the prophets; there were discussions (dull enough) on the age of
Methuselah, a mighty speculation! there were outlines, rude guesses
at the shape of Noah’s Ark and of the riches of Solomon’s Temple;
questions as to the date of the creation, predictions of the end of all
things; the great lapses of time, the strange mutations of the globe
were unfolded with the voluminous leaf, as it turned over; and though
the soul might slumber with an hieroglyphic veil of inscrutable
mysteries drawn over it, yet it was in a slumber ill-exchanged for all
the sharpened realities of sense, wit, fancy, or reason. My father’s
life was comparatively a dream; but it was a dream of infinity and
eternity, of death, the resurrection, and a judgment to come!</p>

<p class='c007'>No two individuals were ever more unlike than were the host and
his guest. A poet was to my father a sort of nondescript: yet whatever
added grace to the Unitarian cause was to him welcome. He
could hardly have been more surprised or pleased, if our visitor had
worn wings. Indeed, his thoughts had wings; and as the silken
sounds rustled round our little wainscoted parlour, my father threw
back his spectacles over his forehead, his white hairs mixing with its
sanguine hue; and a smile of delight beamed across his rugged cordial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>face, to think that Truth had found a new ally in Fancy!<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c008'><sup>[50]</sup></a> Besides,
Coleridge seemed to take considerable notice of me, and that of itself
was enough. He talked very familiarly, but agreeably, and glanced
over a variety of subjects. At dinner-time he grew more animated,
and dilated in a very edifying manner on Mary Wolstonecraft and
Mackintosh. The last, he said, he considered (on my father’s
speaking of his <em>Vindiciæ Gallicæ</em> as a capital performance) as a clever
scholastic man—a master of the topics,—or as the ready warehouseman
of letters, who knew exactly where to lay his hand on what he
wanted, though the goods were not his own. He thought him no
match for Burke, either in style or matter. Burke was a metaphysician,
Mackintosh a mere logician. Burke was an orator (almost
a poet) who reasoned in figures, because he had an eye for nature:
Mackintosh, on the other hand, was a rhetorician, who had only an
eye to common-places. On this I ventured to say that I had always
entertained a great opinion of Burke, and that (as far as I could find)
the speaking of him with contempt might be made the test of a vulgar
democratical mind. This was the first observation I ever made to
Coleridge, and he said it was a very just and striking one. I remember
the leg of Welsh mutton and the turnips on the table that day
had the finest flavour imaginable. Coleridge added that Mackintosh
and Tom Wedgwood (of whom, however, he spoke highly) had
expressed a very indifferent opinion of his friend Mr. Wordsworth,
on which he remarked to them—‘He strides on so far before you,
that he dwindles in the distance!’ Godwin had once boasted to
him of having carried on an argument with Mackintosh for three
hours with dubious success; Coleridge told him—‘If there had been
a man of genius in the room, he would have settled the question in
five minutes.’ He asked me if I had ever seen Mary Wolstonecraft,
and I said, I had once for a few moments, and that she seemed to me
to turn off Godwin’s objections to something she advanced with quite
a playful, easy air. He replied, that ‘this was only one instance of
the ascendancy which people of imagination exercised over those of
mere intellect.’ He did not rate Godwin very high<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c008'><sup>[51]</sup></a> (this was
caprice or prejudice, real or affected) but he had a great idea of
Mrs. Wolstonecraft’s powers of conversation, none at all of her talent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>for book-making. We talked a little about Holcroft. He had been
asked if he was not much struck <em>with</em> him, and he said, he thought
himself in more danger of being struck <em>by</em> him. I complained that
he would not let me get on at all, for he required a definition of every
the commonest word, exclaiming, ‘What do you mean by a <em>sensation</em>,
Sir? What do you mean by an <em>idea</em>?’ This, Coleridge said, was
barricadoing the road to truth:—it was setting up a turnpike gate at
every step we took. I forget a great number of things, many more
than I remember; but the day passed off pleasantly, and the next
morning Mr. Coleridge was to return to Shrewsbury. When I came
down to breakfast, I found that he had just received a letter from his
friend T. Wedgwood, making him an offer of 150<em>l.</em> a-year if he
chose to wave his present pursuit, and devote himself entirely to the
study of poetry and philosophy. Coleridge seemed to make up his
mind to close with this proposal in the act of tying on one of his shoes.
It threw an additional damp on his departure. It took the wayward
enthusiast quite from us to cast him into Deva’s winding vales, or by
the shores of old romance. Instead of living at ten miles distance,
of being the pastor of a Dissenting congregation at Shrewsbury,
he was henceforth to inhabit the Hill of Parnassus, to be a Shepherd
on the Delectable Mountains. Alas! I knew not the way thither,
and felt very little gratitude for Mr. Wedgwood’s bounty. I was
presently relieved from this dilemma; for Mr. Coleridge, asking for
a pen and ink, and going to a table to write something on a bit of
card, advanced towards me with undulating step, and giving me the
precious document, said that that was his address, <em>Mr. Coleridge,
Nether Stowey, Somersetshire</em>; and that he should be glad to see me
there in a few weeks’ time, and, if I chose, would come half-way to
meet me. I was not less surprised than the shepherd-boy (this
simile is to be found in Cassandra) when he sees a thunderbolt fall
close at his feet. I stammered out my acknowledgments and acceptance
of this offer (I thought Mr. Wedgwood’s annuity a trifle to it)
as well as I could; and this mighty business being settled, the poet-preacher
took leave, and I accompanied him six miles on the road.
It was a fine morning in the middle of winter, and he talked the
whole way. The scholar in Chaucer is described as going</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘Sounding on his way.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>So Coleridge went on his. In digressing, in dilating, in passing from
subject to subject, he appeared to me to float in air, to slide on ice.
He told me in confidence (going along) that he should have preached
two sermons before he accepted the situation at Shrewsbury, one on
Infant Baptism, the other on the Lord’s Supper, shewing that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>could not administer either, which would have effectually disqualified
him for the object in view. I observed that he continually crossed
me on the way by shifting from one side of the foot-path to the other.
This struck me as an odd movement; but I did not at that time
connect it with any instability of purpose or involuntary change of
principle, as I have done since. He seemed unable to keep on in
a strait line. He spoke slightingly of Hume (whose Essay on
Miracles he said was stolen from an objection started in one of
South’s sermons—<i><span lang="la">Credat Judæus Apella!</span></i>) I was not very much
pleased at this account of Hume, for I had just been reading, with
infinite relish, that completest of all metaphysical <em>choke-pears</em>, his
<em>Treatise on Human Nature</em>, to which the <cite>Essays</cite>, in point of scholastic
subtlety and close reasoning, are mere elegant trifling, light summer-reading.
Coleridge even denied the excellence of Hume’s general
style, which I think betrayed a want of taste or candour. He however
made me amends by the manner in which he spoke of Berkeley. He
dwelt particularly on his <em>Essay on Vision</em> as a masterpiece of analytical
reasoning. So it undoubtedly is. He was exceedingly angry with
Dr. Johnson for striking the stone with his foot, in allusion to this
author’s Theory of Matter and Spirit, and saying, ‘Thus I confute
him, Sir.’ Coleridge drew a parallel (I don’t know how he brought
about the connection) between Bishop Berkeley and Tom Paine.
He said the one was an instance of a subtle, the other of an acute
mind, than which no two things could be more distinct. The one
was a shop-boy’s quality, the other the characteristic of a philosopher.
He considered Bishop Butler as a true philosopher, a profound and
conscientious thinker, a genuine reader of nature and of his own mind.
He did not speak of his <cite>Analogy</cite>, but of his <em>Sermons at the Rolls’
Chapel</em>, of which I had never heard. Coleridge somehow always
contrived to prefer the <em>unknown</em> to the <em>known</em>. In this instance he
was right. The <cite>Analogy</cite> is a tissue of sophistry, of wire-drawn,
theological special-pleading; the <em>Sermons</em> (with the Preface to them)
are in a fine vein of deep, matured reflection, a candid appeal to our
observation of human nature, without pedantry and without bias. I
told Coleridge I had written a few remarks, and was sometimes
foolish enough to believe that I had made a discovery on the same
subject (the <cite>Natural Disinterestedness of the Human Mind</cite>)—and I
tried to explain my view of it to Coleridge, who listened with great
willingness, but I did not succeed in making myself understood. I
sat down to the task shortly afterwards for the twentieth time, got
new pens and paper, determined to make clear work of it, wrote a
few meagre sentences in the skeleton-style of a mathematical demonstration,
stopped half-way down the second page; and, after trying in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>vain to pump up any words, images, notions, apprehensions, facts, or
observations, from that gulph of abstraction in which I had plunged
myself for four or five years preceding, gave up the attempt as labour
in vain, and shed tears of helpless despondency on the blank unfinished
paper. I can write fast enough now. Am I better than I was
then? Oh no! One truth discovered, one pang of regret at not
being able to express it, is better than all the fluency and flippancy in
the world. Would that I could go back to what I then was! Why
can we not revive past times as we can revisit old places? If I had
the quaint Muse of Sir Philip Sidney to assist me, I would write a
<em>Sonnet to the Road between W——m and Shrewsbury</em>, and immortalise
every step of it by some fond enigmatical conceit. I would swear
that the very milestones had ears, and that Harmer-hill stooped with
all its pines, to listen to a poet, as he passed! I remember but one
other topic of discourse in this walk. He mentioned Paley, praised
the naturalness and clearness of his style, but condemned his sentiments,
thought him a mere time-serving casuist, and said that ‘the
fact of his work on Moral and Political Philosophy being made a
text-book in our Universities was a disgrace to the national character.’
We parted at the six-mile stone; and I returned homeward pensive
but much pleased. I had met with unexpected notice from a person,
whom I believed to have been prejudiced against me. ‘Kind and
affable to me had been his condescension, and should be honoured
ever with suitable regard.’ He was the first poet I had known, and
he certainly answered to that inspired name. I had heard a great
deal of his powers of conversation, and was not disappointed. In
fact, I never met with any thing at all like them, either before or
since. I could easily credit the accounts which were circulated of
his holding forth to a large party of ladies and gentlemen, an evening
or two before, on the Berkeleian Theory, when he made the whole
material universe look like a transparency of fine words; and another
story (which I believe he has somewhere told himself) of his being
asked to a party at Birmingham, of his smoking tobacco and going to
sleep after dinner on a sofa, where the company found him to their no
small surprise, which was increased to wonder when he started up of
a sudden, and rubbing his eyes, looked about him, and launched into
a three-hours’ description of the third heaven, of which he had had
a dream, very different from Mr. Southey’s Vision of Judgment, and
also from that other Vision of Judgment, which Mr. Murray, the
Secretary of the Bridge-street Junto, has taken into his especial keeping!</p>

<p class='c007'>On my way back, I had a sound in my ears, it was the voice of
Fancy: I had a light before me, it was the face of Poetry. The
one still lingers there, the other has not quitted my side! Coleridge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>in truth met me half-way on the ground of philosophy, or I should
not have been won over to his imaginative creed. I had an uneasy,
pleasurable sensation all the time, till I was to visit him. During
those months the chill breath of winter gave me a welcoming; the
vernal air was balm and inspiration to me. The golden sunsets, the
silver star of evening, lighted me on my way to new hopes and
prospects. <em>I was to visit Coleridge in the spring.</em> This circumstance
was never absent from my thoughts, and mingled with all my feelings.
I wrote to him at the time proposed, and received an answer postponing
my intended visit for a week or two, but very cordially urging
me to complete my promise then. This delay did not damp, but
rather increased my ardour. In the meantime, I went to Llangollen
Vale, by way of initiating myself in the mysteries of natural scenery;
and I must say I was enchanted with it. I had been reading Coleridge’s
description of England in his fine <em>Ode on the Departing Year</em>,
and I applied it, <i><span lang="it">con amore</span></i>, to the objects before me. That valley
was to me (in a manner) the cradle of a new existence: in the river
that winds through it, my spirit was baptised in the waters of
Helicon!</p>

<p class='c007'>I returned home, and soon after set out on my journey with
unworn heart and untired feet. My way lay through Worcester and
Gloucester, and by Upton, where I thought of Tom Jones and the
adventure of the muff. I remember getting completely wet through
one day, and stopping at an inn (I think it was at Tewkesbury)
where I sat up all night to read Paul and Virginia. Sweet were the
showers in early youth that drenched my body, and sweet the drops
of pity that fell upon the books I read! I recollect a remark of
Coleridge’s upon this very book, that nothing could shew the gross
indelicacy of French manners and the entire corruption of their
imagination more strongly than the behaviour of the heroine in the
last fatal scene, who turns away from a person on board the sinking
vessel, that offers to save her life, because he has thrown off his
clothes to assist him in swimming. Was this a time to think of such
a circumstance? I once hinted to Wordsworth, as we were sailing
in his boat on Grasmere lake, that I thought he had borrowed the
idea of his <em>Poems on the Naming of Places</em> from the local inscriptions
of the same kind in Paul and Virginia. He did not own the obligation,
and stated some distinction without a difference, in defence of
his claim to originality. Any the slightest variation would be sufficient
for this purpose in his mind; for whatever <em>he</em> added or omitted
would inevitably be worth all that any one else had done, and contain
the marrow of the sentiment. I was still two days before the time
fixed for my arrival, for I had taken care to set out early enough. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>stopped these two days at Bridgewater, and when I was tired of
sauntering on the banks of its muddy river, returned to the inn, and
read Camilla. So have I loitered my life away, reading books,
looking at pictures, going to plays, hearing, thinking, writing on what
pleased me best. I have wanted only one thing to make me happy;
but wanting that, have wanted everything!</p>

<p class='c007'>I arrived, and was well received. The country about Nether
Stowey is beautiful, green and hilly, and near the sea-shore. I saw
it but the other day, after an interval of twenty years, from a hill near
Taunton. How was the map of my life spread out before me, as the
map of the country lay at my feet! In the afternoon, Coleridge took
me over to All-Foxden, a romantic old family-mansion of the St.
Aubins, where Wordsworth lived. It was then in the possession of
a friend of the poet’s, who gave him the free use of it. Somehow
that period (the time just after the French Revolution) was not a
time when <em>nothing was given for nothing</em>. The mind opened, and a
softness might be perceived coming over the heart of individuals,
beneath ‘the scales that fence’ our self-interest. Wordsworth himself
was from home, but his sister kept house, and set before us a
frugal repast; and we had free access to her brother’s poems, the
<cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>, which were still in manuscript, or in the form of
<em>Sybilline Leaves</em>. I dipped into a few of these with great satisfaction,
and with the faith of a novice. I slept that night in an old room
with blue hangings, and covered with the round-faced family-portraits
of the age of George <span class='fss'>I.</span> and <span class='fss'>II.</span> and from the wooded declivity of the
adjoining park that overlooked my window, at the dawn of day,
could</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘——hear the loud stag speak.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the outset of life (and particularly at this time I felt it so) our
imagination has a body to it. We are in a state between sleeping
and waking, and have indistinct but glorious glimpses of strange
shapes, and there is always something to come better than what we
see. As in our dreams the fulness of the blood gives warmth and
reality to the coinage of the brain, so in youth our ideas are clothed,
and fed, and pampered with our good spirits; we breathe thick with
thoughtless happiness, the weight of future years presses on the strong
pulses of the heart, and we repose with undisturbed faith in truth and
good. As we advance, we exhaust our fund of enjoyment and of
hope. We are no longer wrapped in <em>lamb’s-wool</em>, lulled in Elysium.
As we taste the pleasures of life, their spirit evaporates, the sense
palls; and nothing is left but the phantoms, the lifeless shadows of
what <em>has been</em>!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>That morning, as soon as breakfast was over, we strolled out into
the park, and seating ourselves on the trunk of an old ash-tree that
stretched along the ground, Coleridge read aloud with a sonorous and
musical voice, the ballad of <em>Betty Foy</em>. I was not critically or sceptically
inclined. I saw touches of truth and nature, and took the rest
for granted. But in the <em>Thorn</em>, the <em>Mad Mother</em>, and the <em>Complaint
of a Poor Indian Woman</em>, I felt that deeper power and pathos which
have been since acknowledged,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘In spite of pride, in erring reason’s spite,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>as the characteristics of this author; and the sense of a new style and
a new spirit in poetry came over me. It had to me something of the
effect that arises from the turning up of the fresh soil, or of the first
welcome breath of Spring,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘While yet the trembling year is unconfirmed.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Coleridge and myself walked back to Stowey that evening, and his
voice sounded high</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Of Providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fix’d fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>as we passed through echoing grove, by fairy stream or waterfall,
gleaming in the summer moonlight! He lamented that Wordsworth
was not prone enough to believe in the traditional superstitions of the
place, and that there was a something corporeal, a <em>matter-of-fact-ness</em>,
a clinging to the palpable, or often to the petty, in his poetry, in consequence.
His genius was not a spirit that descended to him through
the air; it sprung out of the ground like a flower, or unfolded itself
from a green spray, on which the gold-finch sang. He said, however
(if I remember right) that this objection must be confined to his
descriptive pieces, that his philosophic poetry had a grand and comprehensive
spirit in it, so that his soul seemed to inhabit the universe
like a palace, and to discover truth by intuition, rather than by deduction.
The next day Wordsworth arrived from Bristol at Coleridge’s
cottage. I think I see him now. He answered in some degree to
his friend’s description of him, but was more gaunt and Don Quixote-like.
He was quaintly dressed (according to the <em>costume</em> of that
unconstrained period) in a brown fustian jacket and striped pantaloons.
There was something of a roll, a lounge in his gait, not
unlike his own Peter Bell. There was a severe, worn pressure of
thought about his temples, a fire in his eye (as if he saw something in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>objects more than the outward appearance), an intense high narrow
forehead, a Roman nose, cheeks furrowed by strong purpose and
feeling, and a convulsive inclination to laughter about the mouth, a
good deal at variance with the solemn, stately expression of the rest
of his face. Chantry’s bust wants the marking traits; but he was
teazed into making it regular and heavy: Haydon’s head of him,
introduced into the <em>Entrance of Christ into Jerusalem</em>, is the most like
his drooping weight of thought and expression. He sat down and
talked very naturally and freely, with a mixture of clear gushing
accents in his voice, a deep guttural intonation, and a strong tincture
of the northern <em>burr</em>, like the crust on wine. He instantly began to
make havoc of the half of a Cheshire cheese on the table, and said
triumphantly that ‘his marriage with experience had not been so
unproductive as Mr. Southey’s in teaching him a knowledge of the
good things of this life.’ He had been to see the <em>Castle Spectre</em> by
Monk Lewis, while at Bristol, and described it very well. He said
‘it fitted the taste of the audience like a glove.’ This <em>ad captandum</em>
merit was however by no means a recommendation of it, according to
the severe principles of the new school, which reject rather than court
popular effect. Wordsworth, looking out of the low, latticed window,
said, ‘How beautifully the sun sets on that yellow bank!’ I thought
within myself, ‘With what eyes these poets see nature!’ and ever
after, when I saw the sunset stream upon the objects facing it, conceived
I had made a discovery, or thanked Mr. Wordsworth for
having made one for me! We went over to All-Foxden again the
day following, and Wordsworth read us the story of Peter Bell in
the open air; and the comment made upon it by his face and voice
was very different from that of some later critics! Whatever might
be thought of the poem, ‘his face was as a book where men might
read strange matters,’ and he announced the fate of his hero in prophetic
tones. There is a <em>chaunt</em> in the recitation both of Coleridge
and Wordsworth, which acts as a spell upon the hearer, and disarms
the judgment. Perhaps they have deceived themselves by making
habitual use of this ambiguous accompaniment. Coleridge’s manner
is more full, animated, and varied; Wordsworth’s more equable, sustained,
and internal. The one might be termed more <em>dramatic</em>, the
other more <em>lyrical</em>. Coleridge has told me that he himself liked to
compose in walking over uneven ground, or breaking through the
straggling branches of a copse-wood; whereas Wordsworth always
wrote (if he could) walking up and down a straight gravel-walk, or
in some spot where the continuity of his verse met with no collateral
interruption. Returning that same evening, I got into a metaphysical
argument with Wordsworth, while Coleridge was explaining the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>different notes of the nightingale to his sister, in which we neither of
us succeeded in making ourselves perfectly clear and intelligible.
Thus I passed three weeks at Nether Stowey and in the neighbourhood,
generally devoting the afternoons to a delightful chat in an
arbour made of bark by the poet’s friend Tom Poole, sitting under
two fine elm-trees, and listening to the bees humming round us, while
we quaffed our <em>flip</em>. It was agreed, among other things, that we
should make a jaunt down the Bristol-Channel, as far as Linton.
We set off together on foot, Coleridge, John Chester, and I. This
Chester was a native of Nether Stowey, one of those who were
attracted to Coleridge’s discourse as flies are to honey, or bees in
swarming-time to the sound of a brass pan. He ‘followed in the
chase, like a dog who hunts, not like one that made up the cry.’ He
had on a brown cloth coat, boots, and corduroy breeches, was low in
stature, bow-legged, had a drag in his walk like a drover, which he
assisted by a hazel switch, and kept on a sort of trot by the side of
Coleridge, like a running footman by a state coach, that he might not
lose a syllable or sound that fell from Coleridge’s lips. He told me
his private opinion, that Coleridge was a wonderful man. He scarcely
opened his lips, much less offered an opinion the whole way: yet of
the three, had I to chuse during that journey, I would be John
Chester. He afterwards followed Coleridge into Germany, where
the Kantean philosophers were puzzled how to bring him under any
of their categories. When he sat down at table with his idol, John’s
felicity was complete; Sir Walter Scott’s, or Mr. Blackwood’s, when
they sat down at the same table with the King, was not more so.
We passed Dunster on our right, a small town between the brow of
a hill and the sea. I remember eying it wistfully as it lay below us:
contrasted with the woody scene around, it looked as clear, as pure,
as <em>embrowned</em> and ideal as any landscape I have seen since, of Gaspar
Poussin’s or Domenichino’s. We had a long day’s march—(our
feet kept time to the echoes of Coleridge’s tongue)—through Minehead
and by the Blue Anchor, and on to Linton, which we did not
reach till near midnight, and where we had some difficulty in making
a lodgment. We however knocked the people of the house up at
last, and we were repaid for our apprehensions and fatigue by some
excellent rashers of fried bacon and eggs. The view in coming
along had been splendid. We walked for miles and miles on dark
brown heaths overlooking the Channel, with the Welsh hills beyond,
and at times descended into little sheltered valleys close by the seaside,
with a smuggler’s face scowling by us, and then had to ascend
conical hills with a path winding up through a coppice to a barren
top, like a monk’s shaven crown, from one of which I pointed out to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Coleridge’s notice the bare masts of a vessel on the very edge of the
horizon and within the red-orbed disk of the setting sun, like his own
spectre-ship in the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>. At Linton the character of the
sea-coast becomes more marked and rugged. There is a place called
the <em>Valley of Rocks</em> (I suspect this was only the poetical name for it)
bedded among precipices overhanging the sea, with rocky caverns
beneath, into which the waves dash, and where the sea-gull for ever
wheels its screaming flight. On the tops of these are huge stones
thrown transverse, as if an earthquake had tossed them there, and
behind these is a fretwork of perpendicular rocks, something like the
<em>Giant’s Causeway</em>. A thunder-storm came on while we were at the
inn, and Coleridge was running out bare-headed to enjoy the commotion
of the elements in the <em>Valley of Rocks</em>, but as if in spite, the
clouds only muttered a few angry sounds, and let fall a few refreshing
drops. Coleridge told me that he and Wordsworth were to have
made this place the scene of a prose-tale, which was to have been in
the manner of, but far superior to, the <em>Death of Abel</em>, but they had
relinquished the design. In the morning of the second day, we
breakfasted luxuriously in an old-fashioned parlour, on tea, toast,
eggs, and honey, in the very sight of the bee-hives from which it had
been taken, and a garden full of thyme and wild flowers that had produced
it. On this occasion Coleridge spoke of Virgil’s Georgics,
but not well. I do not think he had much feeling for the classical
or elegant. It was in this room that we found a little worn-out copy
of the <cite>Seasons</cite>, lying in a window-seat, on which Coleridge exclaimed,
‘<em>That</em> is true fame!’ He said Thomson was a great poet, rather
than a good one; his style was as meretricious as his thoughts were
natural. He spoke of Cowper as the best modern poet. He said
the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite> were an experiment about to be tried by him and
Wordsworth, to see how far the public taste would endure poetry
written in a more natural and simple style than had hitherto been
attempted; totally discarding the artifices of poetical diction, and
making use only of such words as had probably been common in the
most ordinary language since the days of Henry <span class='fss'>II.</span> Some comparison
was introduced between Shakespear and Milton. He said
‘he hardly knew which to prefer. Shakespear appeared to him a
mere stripling in the art; he was as tall and as strong, with infinitely
more activity than Milton, but he never appeared to have come to
man’s estate; or if he had, he would not have been a man, but a
monster.’ He spoke with contempt of Gray, and with intolerance
of Pope. He did not like the versification of the latter. He
observed that ‘the ears of these couplet-writers might be charged
with having short memories, that could not retain the harmony of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>whole passages.’ He thought little of Junius as a writer; he had a
dislike of Dr. Johnson; and a much higher opinion of Burke as an
orator and politician, than of Fox or Pitt. He however thought him
very inferior in richness of style and imagery to some of our elder
prose-writers, particularly Jeremy Taylor. He liked Richardson,
but not Fielding; nor could I get him to enter into the merits of
<cite>Caleb Williams</cite>.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c008'><sup>[52]</sup></a> In short, he was profound and discriminating with
respect to those authors whom he liked, and where he gave his judgment
fair play; capricious, perverse, and prejudiced in his antipathies
and distastes. We loitered on the ‘ribbed sea-sands,’ in such talk as
this, a whole morning, and I recollect met with a curious sea-weed,
of which John Chester told us the country name! A fisherman gave
Coleridge an account of a boy that had been drowned the day before,
and that they had tried to save him at the risk of their own lives.
He said ‘he did not know how it was that they ventured, but, Sir,
we have a <em>nature</em> towards one another.’ This expression, Coleridge
remarked to me, was a fine illustration of that theory of disinterestedness
which I (in common with Butler) had adopted. I broached to
him an argument of mine to prove that <em>likeness</em> was not mere association
of ideas. I said that the mark in the sand put one in mind of a
man’s foot, not because it was part of a former impression of a man’s
foot (for it was quite new) but because it was like the shape of a
man’s foot. He assented to the justness of this distinction (which I
have explained at length elsewhere, for the benefit of the curious)
and John Chester listened; not from any interest in the subject, but
because he was astonished that I should be able to suggest any thing
to Coleridge that he did not already know. We returned on the
third morning, and Coleridge remarked the silent cottage-smoke
curling up the valleys where, a few evenings before, we had seen the
lights gleaming through the dark.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a day or two after we arrived at Stowey, we set out, I on my
return home, and he for Germany. It was a Sunday morning, and
he was to preach that day for Dr. Toulmin of Taunton. I asked
him if he had prepared anything for the occasion? He said he had
not even thought of the text, but should as soon as we parted. I did
not go to hear him,—this was a fault,—but we met in the evening at
Bridgewater. The next day we had a long day’s walk to Bristol,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>and sat down, I recollect, by a well-side on the road, to cool ourselves
and satisfy our thirst, when Coleridge repeated to me some
descriptive lines from his tragedy of Remorse; which I must say
became his mouth and that occasion better than they, some years
after, did Mr. Elliston’s and the Drury Lane boards,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh memory! shield me from the world’s poor strife,</div>
      <div class='line'>And give those scenes thine everlasting life.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I saw no more of him for a year or two, during which period he
had been wandering in the Hartz Forest in Germany; and his
return was cometary, meteorous, unlike his setting out. It was not
till some time after that I knew his friends Lamb and Southey. The
last always appears to me (as I first saw him) with a common-place
book under his arm, and the first with a <em>bon-mot</em> in his mouth. It
was at Godwin’s that I met him with Holcroft and Coleridge, where
they were disputing fiercely which was the best—<em>Man as he was, or
man as he is to be</em>. ‘Give me,’ says Lamb, ‘man as he is <em>not</em> to be.’
This saying was the beginning of a friendship between us, which I
believe still continues.—Enough of this for the present.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PULPIT ORATORY—DR. CHALMERS AND MR. IRVING</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Liberal.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>1823.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>The Scotch at present seem to bear the bell, and to have ‘got the
start of the majestic world.’ They boast of the greatest novelists,
the greatest preachers, the greatest philanthropists, and the greatest
blackguards in the world. Sir Walter Scott stands at the head of
these for Scotch humour, Dr. Chalmers for Scotch logic, Mr. Owen
for Scotch Utopianism, and Mr. Blackwood for Scotch impudence.
Unrivalled four! Nay, here is Mr. Irving, who threatens to make a
fifth, and <em>stultify</em> all our London orators, from ‘kingly Kensington’
to Blackwall! Who has not heard of him? Who does not go to
hear him? You can scarcely move along for the coronet-coaches
that besiege the entrance to the Caledonian chapel in Hatton-garden;
and when, after a prodigious squeeze, you get in so as to have standing-room,
you see in the same undistinguished crowd Brougham and
Mackintosh, Mr. Peel and Lord Liverpool, Lord Landsdown and
Mr. Coleridge. Mr. Canning and Mr. Hone are pew fellows.
Mr. Waithman frowns stern applause, and Mr. Alderman Wood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>does the honours of the Meeting! The lamb lies down with the
lion, and the Millennium seems to be anticipated in the Caledonian
chapel, under the new Scotch preacher. Lords, ladies, sceptics,
fanatics, join in approbation,—some admire the doctrine, others the
sound, some the picturesque appearance of the orator, others the grace
of action, some the ingenuity of the argument, others the beauty of
the style or the bursts of passion, some even go so far as to patronize
a certain <em>brackish</em> infusion of the Scottish dialect, and a slight defect
of vision. Lady Bluemount declares it to be only inferior to the
<span class='sc'>Excursion</span> in imagination, and Mr. Botherby cries—‘Good, good!’
The ‘Talking Potato’<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c008'><sup>[53]</sup></a> and Mr. Theodore Flash have not yet been.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Irving appears to us the most accomplished barbarian, and the
least offensive and most dashing clerical holder-forth we remember to
have seen. He puts us in mind of the first man, Adam, if Adam
had but been a Scotchman, and had had coal black hair. He seems
to stand up in the integrity of his composition, to begin a new race of
practising believers, to give a new impulse to the Christian religion,
to regenerate the fallen and degenerate race of man. You would say
he had been turned out of the hands of Nature and the Schools a
perfect piece of workmanship. See him in the street, he has the air,
the free swing, the <em>bolt upright</em> figure of an Indian savage, or a northern
borderer dressed in canonicals: set him in the pulpit, and he is armed
with all the topics, a master of fence, the pupil of Dr. Chalmers!
In action he has been compared to Kean; in the union of external
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>and intellectual advantages, we might start a parallel for him in the
admirable Crichton. He stands before Haydon’s picture of Lazarus,
and says, ‘Look at me! ’ He crosses Piccadilly, and clears Bond-street
of its beaux! Rob Roy, Macbriar is come again. We saw
him stretched on a bench at the Black Bull in Edinburgh,—we met
him again at a thirteen-penny ordinary in London, in the same attitude,
and said, without knowing his calling, or his ghostly parts, ‘That is
the man for a fair saint.’ We swear it by</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘His foot mercurial; his martial thigh;</div>
      <div class='line'>The brawns of Hercules, but his jovial face!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Aye, there we stop like Imogen—there is a want of expression in it.
‘The iron has not entered his soul.’ He has not dared to feel but in
trammels and in dread. He has read Werter but to criticise him;
Rousseau, but to steel himself against him; Shakespear, but to quote
him; Milton, but to round his periods. Pleasure, fancy, humanity,
are syrens that he repels and keeps at arms-length; and hence his
features are hardened, and have a barbaric crust upon them. They
are not steeped in the expression of Titian or Raphael; but they
would do for Spagnoletti to paint, and his dark profile and matted
locks have something of the grave commanding appearance of
Leonardo da Vinci’s massive portraits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Chalmers is not so good-looking a man as Mr. Irving; he
wants the same vigour and spirit. His face is dead and clammy,
cold, pale, bloodless, passionless, and there is a glazed look of insincerity
about the eyes, uninformed, uninspired from within. His
voice is broken, harsh, and creaking, while Mr. Irving’s is flowing
and silvery: his Scotch accent and pronunciation are a terrible infliction
on the <em>uncultivated</em> ear. His ‘Whech observation I <em>oo</em>rge upon you
my frinds and br<em>ee</em>thren’ desolates and lays waste all the humanities.
He grinds out his sentences between his teeth, and catches at truth
with his fists, as a monkey catches an apple or a stick thrown at him
with his paws. He seems by his action and his utterance to say to
difficulties, ‘Come, let me clutch thee,’ and having got them in his
grasp, tears and rends them in pieces as a dog tears an old rag to
tatters or mumbles a stone that is flung in his way. Dr. Chalmers
engages attention and secures sympathy solely by the intensity of his
own purpose: there is neither eloquence nor wisdom, neither imagination
nor feeling, neither the pomp of sound nor grace nor solemnity
of manner about him, but he is in earnest, and eager in pursuit of his
argument, and arrests the eye and ear of his congregation by this
alone. He dashes head foremost into the briars and thorns of controversy,
and drags you along with him whether you will or no, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>your only chance is to push on and get out of them as well as you
can, though dreadfully scratched and almost blinded. He involves
you in a labyrinth, and you are anxious to escape from it: you have
to pass through many a dark, subterranean cavern with him in his
theological ferry-boat, and are glad enough to get out on the other
side, with the help of Scotch logic for oars, and Scotch rhetoric for
sails! You hear no <em>home</em> truths, nothing that touches the heart, or
swells or expands the soul; there is no tide of eloquence lifting you
up to Heaven, or wafting you from Indus to the Pole.—No, you are
detained in a canal, with a great number of <em>locks</em> in it.—You make
way by virtue of standing still, your will is irritated, and impelled
forward by stoppages—you are puzzled into sympathy, pulled into
admiration, tired into patience! The preacher starts a difficulty, of
which you had no notion before, and you stare to see how he will
answer it. He first makes you uneasy, sceptical, sensible of your
helplessness and dependence upon his superior sagacity and recondite
learning, and proportionably thankful for the relief he affords you in
the unpleasant dilemma to which you have been reduced. It is like
proposing a riddle, and then, after playing with the curiosity and
impatience of the company for some time, giving the solution, which
nobody else has the wit to find out. We never saw fuller attendances
or more profound attention than at the Tron Church in Glasgow—it
was like a sea of eyes, a swarm of heads, gaping for mysteries, and
staring for elucidations—it was not the sublime or beautiful; the
secret was that which has been here explained, a desire to get rid of
the difficult, the disagreeable, the dry, and the discordant matter that
had been conjured up in the imagination. Dr. Chalmers, then, succeeds
by the force of sophistry and casuistry, in our humble judgment.
Riddles (of which we spoke just now) are generally traditional:
those that Dr. Chalmers unfolds from the pulpit, are of his own
invention, or at least promulgation. He started an objection to the
Christian religion (founded on its supposed inconsistency with the
Newtonian philosophy) which objection had never been noticed in
books, on purpose that he might answer it. ‘Well,’ said a Scotchman,
‘and if the answer was a good one, was he not right?’ ‘No,
assuredly,’ we should answer, ‘for there is no faith so firm as that
which has never been called in question.’ The answer could only
satisfy those who had been unsettled by the question; and there
would be many who would not be convinced by the Doctor’s reasoning,
however he might plume himself on his success. We suspect
that this is looking after a reputation for literary ingenuity and philosophical
depth, rather than the peace of consciences or the salvation
of souls; which, in a Christian minister, is unbecoming, and savours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>of the Mammon of unrighteousness. We ourselves were staggered
by the blow (either then or long before) and still gasp for a reply,
notwithstanding Dr. Chalmers’s nostrum. Let the reader briefly
judge:—The Doctor tells us, it may be said, that the Christian
Dispensation supposes that the counsels of God turn upon this world
as its center; that there is a heaven above and an earth beneath; and
that man is the lord of the universe, the only creature made in the
divine likeness, and over whom Providence watches, and to whom
revelations are given, and an inheritance everlasting. This agrees
with the cosmogony of Moses, which makes the earth the center of
all things, and the sun, moon, and stars, little shining spots like silver
sixpences moving round it. But it does not so well agree with
Newton’s <cite>Principia</cite> (we state Dr. Chalmers’s objection) which supposes
the globe we inhabit to be but a point in the immensity of the
universe; that ours is but one, and that the most insignificant (perhaps)
among innumerable worlds, filled, probably, with created
intelligences, rational and fallen souls, that share the eye of God
with us, and who require to know that their Redeemer liveth. We
alone (it would appear) cannot pretend to monopolize heaven or hell:
there are other contingent candidates besides us. Jacob’s dream was
poetical and natural, while the earth was supposed to be a flat surface
and the blue sky hung over it, to which angels might ascend by a
ladder, and the face of God be seen at the top, as his lofty and
unchangeable abode; but this beautiful episode hardly accords with
the Antipodes. Sir Isaac turned the world upon its back, and
divided heaven from itself, and removed it far from every one of us.
As we thought the universe turned round the earth as its pivot, so
religion turned round man as its center, as the sole, important, moral
and accountable agent in existence. But there are other worlds
revolving in infinite space, to which this is a speck. Are they all
desert, worthless? Were they made for us? Have they no especial
dispensations of life and light? Have we alone a God, a Saviour,
revealed to us? Is religion triumphant only here, or is it itinerant
through each? It can hardly seem that we alone have occupied the
thoughts or been the sole objects of the plans of infinite wisdom from
eternity—that our life, resurrection, and judgment to come, are the
whole history of a wide-seeing Providence, or the loftiest events in
the grand drama of the universe, which was got up as a theatre only
for us to perform our petty parts in, and then to be cast, most of us,
into hell fire? Dr. Chalmers’s Astronomical Discourses indeed may
be said to dwarf his mighty subject, and make mankind a very Lilliputian
race of beings, which this Gulliver in vain dandles in the hard,
broad, brawny hand of school divinity, and tries to lift into their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>bigotted self-sufficiency and exclusive importance again. How does
he answer his own objection, and turn the tables on himself—how
reverse this pitiful, diminished perspective, and aggrandise us in our
own estimation once more as undoubted heirs of heaven or of hell—the
sole favoured or reprobated sons of God? Why, his answer is
this—that the microscope has done as much to lift man in the scale
of being, and to enlarge the bounds of this atom the earth, as the
telescope has done to circumscribe and lessen it; that there are
infinite gradations <span class='fss'>BELOW</span> man, worlds within worlds, as there are
degrees of being above, and stars and suns blazing round each other;
that, for what we know, a speck, a lucid drop circulating in a flea’s
back, may be another habitable globe like this!—And has that, too, a
revelation of its own, an avenging God, and a Christ crucified?
Does every particle in a flea’s back contain a Mosaic dispensation,
a Popish and a Protestant religion? Has it its Tron Church and its
Caledonian Chapel, and Dr. Chalmers’s Discourses and Mr. Irving’s
Orations in little? This does not seem to obviate the difficulty, but
to increase it a million-fold. It is his objection and his answer to it,
not ours: if blasphemy, it is his; and, if orthodoxy, he is entitled to
all the credit of it. But his whole scheme shows how impossible it
is to reconcile the faith delivered to the saints with the subtleties and
intricacies of metaphysics. It displays more pride of intellect than
simplicity of heart, is an insult equally on the understandings or
prejudices of men, and could only have been hit upon by that personification
and abstraction of cross-purposes, a Scotch metaphysical
divine. In his general preaching, Dr. Chalmers is a great casuist,
and a very indifferent moralist. He states the <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em> of every
question with extreme pertinacity, and often ‘spins the thread of his
verbosity finer than the staple of his argument.’ He assigns possible
reasons, not practical motives, for conduct; and vindicates the ways of
God, and his own interpretation of the Scriptures, to the head, not to
the heart. The old school-divines set this practice afoot; for being
accustomed to hear the secrets of confession, and to salve the tender
consciences of the great and powerful, they had to bandy all sorts of
questions about; and if they could find out ‘a loop or peg to hang
a doubt on,’ were well rewarded for their trouble; they were constantly
reduced to their shifts, and forced to go on the forlorn hope
of morality by the ticklish cases referred to them for arbitration; and
when they had exhausted the resources of humanity and natural
sentiment, endeavoured to find new topics within the range of abstract
reason and possibility. Dr. Chalmers’s reasoning is as unlike as
possible to a chapter in the Gospels: but he may do very well to
comment on the Apocalypse or an Epistle of St. Paul’s. We do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>not approve of this method of carving out excuses or defences of
doctrinal points from the dry parchment of the understanding or the
cobwebs of the brain. Whatever sets or leaves the dogmas of religion
at variance with the dictates of the heart, hardens the last, and lends
no advantage to the first.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Irving is a more amiable moralist, and a more practical reasoner.
He throws a glancing, pleasing light over the gloomy ground of
Calvinism. There is something humane in his appeals, striking in his
apostrophes, graceful in his action, soothing in the tones of his voice.
He is not affected and theatrical; neither is he deeply impassioned or
overpowering from the simple majesty of his subject. He is above
common-place both in fancy and argument; yet he can hardly rank as
a poet or philosopher. He is a modernised covenanter, a sceptical
fanatic. We do not feel exactly on sure ground with him—we
scarcely know whether he preaches Christ crucified, or himself. His
pulpit style has a resemblance to the <em>florid gothic</em>. We are a little
<em>mystified</em> when a man with one hand brings us all the nice distinctions
and air-drawn speculations of modern unbelievers, and arms the other
with ‘fire hot from Hell,’—when St. Paul and Jeremy Bentham, the
Evangelists and the Sorrows of Werter, Seneca, Shakespear, the
author of Caleb Williams and the Political Justice, are mingled
together in the same passage, and quoted in the same breath, however
eloquent that breath may be. We see Mr. Irving smile with decent
scorn at this remark, and launch one more thunderbolt at the
critics. He is quite welcome, and we should be proud of his notice.
In the discourses he has lately delivered, and which have drawn
crowds to admire them, he has laboured to describe the Sensual
Man, the Intellectual Man, the Moral Man, and the Spiritual
Man; and has sacrificed the three first at the shrine of the
last. He gave certainly a terrific picture of the death-bed of the
Sensual Man—a scene where few shine—but it is a good subject for
oratory, and he made the most of it. He described the Poet well,
walking by the mountain side, in the eye of nature—yet oppressed,
panting rather than satisfied, with beauty and sublimity. Neither
Fame nor Genius, it is most true, are all-sufficient to the mind of
man! He made a fair hit at the Philosophers; first, at the Political
Economist, who draws a circle round man, gives him so many feet of
earth to stand upon, and there leaves him to starve in all his nobler
parts and faculties: next, at the great Jurisconsult, who carves out a
mosaic work of motives for him, cold, hard, and dry, and expects
him to move mechanically in right lines, squares, and parallelograms,
drills him into perfection, and screws him into utility. He then fell
foul of the Moralist and Sentimentalist, weighed him in the balance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>and found him wanting—deficient in clearness of sight to discern
good, in strength of hand and purpose to seize upon it when discerned.
But Religion comes at last to the aid of the Spiritual Man, couches
the blind sight, and braces the paralytic limb; the Lord of Hosts is
in the field, and the battle is won, his countenance pours light into our
souls, and his hand stretched out imparts strength to us, by which we
tower to our native skies! In treating of this subject, Mr. Irving
introduced several powerful images and reflections, to show how feeble
moral and intellectual motives are to contend with the allurements of
sense and the example of the world. Reason alone, he said, was no
more able to stem the tide of prejudice and fashion, than the swimmer
with his single arm (here he used an appropriate and spirited gesture,
which reminded us of the description of the heroic action of the
swimmer in Sir Philip Sidney’s Arcadia) is able to oppose the raging
torrent, as the voice of conscience was only heard in the tumultuous
scenes of life like the faint cry of the sea-bird in the wide world of
waters. He drew an animated but mortifying sketch of the progress
of the Patriot and Politician, weaned by degrees from his attachment
to young Liberty to hug old Corruption; and showed (strikingly
enough) that this change from youthful ardour to a hoary, heartless
old age of selfishness and ridicule (there were several Members of the
Honourable House present) was not owing to increased wisdom or
strength of sight, but to faltering resolution and weakness of hand,
that could no longer hold out against the bribes, the snares, and gilded
chains prepared for it. The romantic Tyro was right and free, the
callous Courtier was a slave and self-conceited. All this was true;
it was honest, downright, and well put. There was no cant in it, as
far as regards the unequal odds and the hard battle that reason has to
fight with pleasure, or ambition, or interest, or other antagonist
motives. But does the objection apply to morality solely, or has not
religion its share in it? Man is not what he ought to be—Granted;
but is he not different from this ideal standard, in spite of religion as
well as of morality? Is not the religious man often a slave to power,
the victim of pleasure, the thrall of avarice, hard of heart, a sensual
hypocrite, cunning, mercenary, miserable? If it be said that the
really religious man is none of these, neither is the truly moral
man. Real morality, as well as vital Christianity, implies right
conduct and consistent principle. But the question simply at issue
is, whether the profession or the belief of sound moral opinion
implies these; and it certainly does it no more than the profession
or belief of orthodox religious opinions does. The conviction
of the good or ill consequences of our actions in this life does not
absolutely conform the will or the desires to good; neither does the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>apprehension of future rewards or punishments produce this effect
completely or necessarily. The candidate for Heaven is a backslider;
the dread of eternal torments makes but a temporary impression
on the mind. This is not a reason, in our judgment, for neglecting
or giving up in despair the motives of religion or morality, but for
strengthening and cultivating both. With Mr. Irving, it is a triumphant
and unanswerable ground for discarding and denouncing morality,
and for exalting religion, as the sovereign cure for all wounds, as the
<em>thaumaturgos</em>, or wonder-worker, in the reform of mankind! We are
at a loss to understand how this exclusive and somewhat intolerant
view of the subject is reconcileable with sound reason or with history.
Religion is no new experiment now first making on mankind; we live
in the nineteenth century of the Christian æra; it is not as if we lived
in the age of apostles, when we might (from novelty and inexperience
of the intended dispensations of Providence) expect the earth to wear
a new face, and darkness suddenly to flee away before the light of the
gospel: nor do we apprehend that Mr. Irving is one of those who
believe with Mr. Croly, that the millennium actually commenced with
the battle of Waterloo; that event seems as far off, to all outward
appearance, as it was two thousand years ago. What does this make
against the doctrines of Christianity? Nothing; if, as far as they are
implanted and take root, they bear fruit accordingly, notwithstanding
the repugnance and thanklessness of the soil. Why then is
Mr. Irving so hard upon the labours of philosophers, moralists, and
men of letters, because they do not do all their work at once?
Bishop Butler indeed wrote a most able and learned quarto volume,
to prove that the slow growth and imperfect influence of Christianity
was a proof of its divine origin, and that in this respect we had a right
to look for a direct <em>analogy</em> between the operations of the world of
grace and nature, both proceeding as they did from the same Almighty
hands! Our deservedly popular preacher has, however, an answer to
what we have here stated: he says, ‘the time <span class='fss'>MUST</span> and <span class='fss'>WILL</span> shortly
come!’ We never contradict prophecies; we only speak to facts.
In addressing himself to this point, Mr. Irving made a spirited
digression to the Missionary Societies, and the impending propagation
of the Gospel at home and abroad—all obstacles to it would speedily
be surmounted:—‘The Negro slave was not so enchained but that the
Gospel would set him free; the Hottentot was not so benighted but
that its light would penetrate to him; the South Sea Islander was not
so indolent and voluptuous but that he would rouse himself at its call;
neither the cunning of the Italian, nor the superstition of the Spaniard,
nor the tameness of the German, nor the levity of the French, nor
the buoyancy of the Irish, nor the indomitable pride of the English,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>nor the <em>fiery manhood</em> of the Scotch, would be long able to withstand
its all-pervading influence!’ We confess, when our Caledonian
pastor launched his canoe from the South Sea Isles and landed on
European <em>terra firma</em>, taking measure of the vices of each nation that
were opposed to the spirit of Christianity, we did <em>prick up</em> our ears to
know what fault he would, in due course of argument, find with his
native country—it would go against the grain, no doubt, but still he
had undertaken it, and he must speak out—When lo! for some
sneaking vice or sordid pettifogging disposition, we have our own
‘best virtue’ palmed upon us as the only failing of the most magnanimous
natives of the North—<em>fiery manhood</em>, quotha! The cold
sweat of rankling malice, hypocrisy, and servility, would be nearer
the mark—Eh! Sir Walter? Nay, good Mr. Blackwood, we
meant no offence to you! ‘Fiery manhood’ is the Anti-Christian
vice or virtue of the Scotch that meets true religion on the borders,
and beats her back with suffocating breath! Is Christianity still
then to be planted like oak timber in Scotland? What will Dr.
Chalmers and the other labourers in the vineyard say to this?—‘We
pause for a reply!’ The best and most impressive part of Mr.
Irving’s discourse (Sunday, the 22nd June) was that, in which he
gave a very beautiful account of what Christianity had done, or rather
might do, in aid of morality and the regeneration of the spirit of man.
It had made ‘corruption blossom,’ ‘annihilated time in the prospect
of eternity,’ and ‘changed all nature, from a veil hiding the face of
God, into a mirror reflecting his power and beneficence.’ We do
not, however, see why in the fervour of his enthusiasm he should
affirm ‘that Jesus Christ had destroyed melody,’ nor why, by any
allowed licence of speech, he should talk of ‘the mouth of God being
muzzled by man.’ We might not perhaps have noticed this last
expression, considering it as a slip of the tongue; but Mr. Irving
preaches from written notes, and his style is, on the whole, polished
and ambitious. We can conceive of a deeper strain of argument, of
a more powerful and overwhelming flood of eloquence; but altogether
we deem him an able and attractive expounder of Holy Writ; and
farther, we believe him to be an honest man. We suspect there is a
radical ‘taint in him,’ and that Mr. Canning will be advised to withdraw
himself from the congregation. His strokes aimed at iniquity
in high places are bold, unsparing, and repeated. We would however
suggest to him the propriety of containing his indignation at the
advancement of the secular priesthood by ‘the powers that be;’ it is
a thing of course, and his impatience of their elevation may be
invidiously construed into a jealousy of the spoil. When we compare
Mr. Irving with some other preachers that we have heard, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>particularly with that crawling sycophant Daniel Wilson (who tendered
his gratuitous submission to Nero the other day in the excess of his
loyalty to George <span class='fss'>IV.</span>) we are sorry that we have not been able to
make our tribute of approbation unqualified as it is cordial, and to
stifle <em>their</em> venal breath with the applauses bestowed upon <em>him</em>. ‘Oh!
for an <em>eulogy</em> to kill’ all such with!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ARGUING IN A CIRCLE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Liberal.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[1823.</span></p>

<p class='c006'>There was an account in the newspapers the other day of a fracas in
the street, in which a Lord and one or two Members of Parliament
were concerned. It availed them nought to plead the privilege of
Peerage, or to have made speeches in the House—they were held to
bail, like the vilest of the rabble, and the circumstance was not considered
one to come before the public. Ah! it is that public that is
the sad thing. It is the most tremendous ring that ever was formed
to see fair play between man and man; it puts people on their good
behaviour immediately; and wherever it exists, there is an end of the
airs and graces which individuals, high in rank, and low in understanding
and morals, may chuse to give themselves. While the affair
is private and can be kept in a corner, personal fear and favour are
the ruling principles, <em>might</em> prevails over <em>right</em>: but bring it before the
world, and truth and justice stand some chance. The public is too
large a body to be bribed or browbeat. Its voice, deep and loud,
quails the hearts of princes: its breath would make the feather in a
lord’s cap bend and cower before it, if its glance, measuring the real
magnitude of such persons with their lofty, tiptoe, flaunting pretensions,
had not long since taken the feathers out of their caps. A lord
is now dressed (oh! degenerate world) like any other man; and a
watchman will no sooner let go his grasp of his plain collar than he
will that of a Commoner or any other man, who has his ‘fancies and
good-nights.’ What a falling off is here from the time when if a ‘base
cullionly fellow’ had dared to lay hands on a nobleman, on ‘one of
quality,’ he would have whipped his sword out of its scabbard and
run him through the body; the ‘beggarly, unmannered corse’ would
have been thrown into the Thames or the next ditch; and woe to
any person that should have attempted to make a stir in the matter!
‘The age of chivalry is gone, that of constables, legislators, and
Grub-street writers, has succeeded, and the glory of heraldry is
extinguished for ever.’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Poor Sir Walter! the times are changed indeed, since a Duke of
Buckingham could send a couple of bullies, equipped in his livery, with
swords and ribbons, to carry off a young lady from a Peveril of the Peak,
by main force, in the face of day, and yet the bye-standers not dare to
interfere, from a dread of the Duke’s livery and the High Court of
Star Chamber! It is no wonder that the present Duke of Buckingham
(the old title new revived) makes speeches in the Upper House to
prove that legitimate monarchs have a right, whenever they please,
to run their swords through the heart of a nation and <em>pink</em> the liberties
of mankind, thinking if this doctrine were once fully restored, the old
times of his predecessor might come again,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘New manners and the pomp of elder days!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is in tracing the history of private manners that we see (more than
any thing else) the progress that has been made in public opinion and
political liberty, and that may be still farther made. No one individual
now sets up his will as higher than the law: no noble Duke or
Baron bold acts the professed bully or glories in the character of a
lawless ruffian, as a part of the etiquette and privileges of high rank:
no gay, gaudy minion of the court takes the wall of the passengers,
sword in hand, cuts a throat, washes his white, crimson-spotted hands,
and then to dinner with the king and the ladies.—<em>That</em> is over with
us at present; and while that is the case, Hampden will not have
bled in the field, nor Sydney on the scaffold, in vain! Even the
monarch in this country, though he is above the law, is subject to
opinion; ‘submits,’ as Mr. Burke has it, both from choice and
necessity, ‘to the soft collar of social esteem, and gives a domination,
vanquisher of laws, to be subdued by manners!’</p>

<p class='c007'>It is this which drives the Despots of the Continent mad, and
makes their nobles and chief vassals league together, like a herd of
tygers, to destroy the example of liberty which we (the people of
England) have set to the rest of the world. They are afraid that if
this example should spread and things go on much farther in the road
they have taken, they will no longer be able to give their subjects and
dependants the <em>knout</em>, to send them to the galleys or a dungeon without
any warrant but their own unbridled will, and that a lord or a
king will be no more above the law than any other man. Mankind,
in short, till lately and except in this country, were considered as
a herd of deer which the privileged classes were to use for their
pleasure, or which they were to hunt down for spite or sport, as liked
them best. That they should combine together with a knot of obscure
philosophers and hair-brained philanthropists, to set up a plea not to
be used at any man’s pleasure, or hunted down like vermin for any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>man’s sport, was an insult to be avenged with seas of blood, an attack
upon the foundations of social order, and the very existence of all
law, religion, and morality. In all the legitimate governments of
Europe, there existed, and there still exist, a number of individuals
who were exempted (by birth and title) from the law, who could
offer every affront to religion, and commit every outrage upon morality
with impunity, with insolence and loud laughter, and who pretended
that in asserting this monstrous privilege of theirs to the very letter, the
essence of all law, religion, and morality consisted. This was the
case in France till the year 1789. The only law was the will of the
rich to insult and harass the poor, the only religion a superstitious
mummery, the only morality subserviency to the pleasures of the
great. In the mild reign of Louis <span class='fss'>XV.</span> only, there were fifteen
thousand <em>lettres de cachet</em> issued for a number of private, nameless
offences, such as the withholding a wife or daughter from the embraces
of some man of rank, for having formerly received favours from
a king’s mistress, or writing an epigram on a Minister of State. It
was on the ruins of this flagitious system (no less despicable than
detestable) that the French Revolution rose; and the towers of the
Bastille, as they fell, announced the proud truth in welcome thunder
to the human race—to all but those who thought they were born, and
who only wished to live, to exercise their sweeping, wholesale, ruthless
tyranny, or to vent the workings of their petty, rankling spleen,
pride, bigotry, and malice, in endless, tormenting details on their
fellow-creatures.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will, I conceive, hereafter be considered as the greatest enormity
in history, the stupidest and the most barefaced insult that ever was
practised on the understandings or the rights of men, that we should
interfere in this quarrel between liberty and slavery, take the wrong
side, and endeavour to suppress the natural consequences of that very
example of freedom we had set. That we should do this, we who
had ‘long insulted the slavery of Europe by the loudness of our
boasts of freedom,’ who had laughed at the <em>Grand Monarque</em> for the
last hundred and fifty years, and treated his subjects with every
indignity, as belonging to an inferior species to ourselves, for submitting
to his cruel and enervated sway; that the instant they took
us at our word and were willing to break the chains of Popery and
Slavery that we never ceased to taunt them with, we should turn
against them, stand passive by ‘with jealous leer malign,’ witnessing
the machinations of despots to extinguish the rising liberties of the
world, and with the first plausible protest, the first watch-word given
(the blow aimed at the head of a king confederate with the enemies
of his country against its freedom) should join the warwhoop, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>continue it loudest and longest, and never rest, under one hollow,
dastard, loathsome pretence or other, till we had put down ‘the last
example of democratic rebellion’ (we, who are nothing but rebellion
all over, from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot!) and
had restored the doctrine of Divine Right, that had fallen headless
from its throne of Ignorance and Superstition with the First Charles,
long before it was condemned to the same fate in the person of the
French king; that we should do this, and be led, urged on to the
unhallowed task by a descendant of the House of Brunswick, who
held his crown in contempt of the Stuarts, and grew old, blind, and
crazed in the unsated, undiverted, sacred thirst of Legitimacy, is
a thing that posterity will wonder at. We pretend to have interfered
to put down the horrors of the French Revolution, when it was our
interference (with that of others) that produced those horrors, of
which we were glad as an excuse to justify our crooked policy and to
screen the insidious, deadly, fatal blow aimed at liberty. No; the
‘cause was hearted’ in the breasts of those who reign, or who would
reign, in contempt of the people, and with whom it rests to make
peace or war. Is not the same principle at work still? What
horrors have the <em>Holy</em> <span class='sc'>Alliance</span> to plead in vindication of their
interference with Spain? They have not a rag, a thread of all their
hideous tissue of sophistry and lies to cover ‘the open and apparent
shame’ of this sequel and consistent comment on their former conduct.
It is a naked, barefaced, undisguised attack upon the rights and
liberties of the world: it is putting the thing upon its true and proper
footing—the claim of Kings to hold mankind as a property in perpetuity.
There are no horrors, real or pretended, to warrant this
new outrage on common sense and human nature. It stands on
its own proud basis of injustice—it towers and mocks the skies in
all the majesty of regal wrong. ‘The shame, the blood be upon
their heads.’ If there are no horrors ready-made to their hands,
they stand upon their privilege to commit wanton outrage and unqualified
aggression; and if by these means they can provoke horrors,
then the last are put first as the most plausible plea, as a handsome
mask and soft lining to the hard gripe and features of Legitimacy—Religion
consecrates, and Loyalty sanctions the fraud! But,
should the scheme fail in spite of every art and effort, and the wrong
they have meditated be retorted on their own heads, then we shall
have, as before, an appeal made to Liberty and Humanity—the motto
of despots will once more be <em>peace on earth and good will to men</em>—and
we too shall join in the yell of blood and the whine of humanity.
We are only waiting for an excuse now—till the threats and insults
and cruelties of insolent invaders call forth reprisals, and lead to some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>act of popular fury or national justice that shall serve as a signal to
rouse the torpid spirit of trade in the city, or to inflame the loyalty of
country gentlemen deaf for the present to all other sounds but that
appalling one of <span class='sc'>Rent</span>! We must remain neuter while a grievous
wrong is acting, unless we can get something by the change, or pick
a quarrel with the right. We are peaceable, politic, when a nation’s
liberty only is at stake, but were it a monarch’s crown that hung
tottering in the air, oh! how soon would a patriot senate and people
start out to avenge the idle cause: a single speech from the throne
would metamorphose us into martyrs of self-interest, saviours of the
world, deliverers of Europe from lawless violence and unexampled
wrong. But here we have no heart to stir, because the name of
liberty alone (without the cant of loyalty) has lost its magic charm
on the ears of Englishmen—impotent to save, powerful only to betray
and destroy themselves and others!</p>

<p class='c007'>We want a Burke to give the thing a legitimate turn at present.
I am afraid the Editor of the <em>New Times</em> can hardly supply his place.
They could hardly have done before, without that eloquent apostate,
that brilliant sophist, to throw his pen into the scale against truth and
liberty. He varnished over a bad cause with smooth words, and had
power to ‘make the worse appear the better reason’—the devil’s
boast! The madness of genius was necessary to second the madness
of a court; his flaming imagination was the torch that kindled the
smouldering fire in the inmost sanctuary of pride and power, and
spread havoc, dismay, and desolation through the world. The light of
his imagination, sportive, dazzling, beauteous as it seemed, was followed
by the stroke of death. It so happens that I myself have played all my
life with his forked shafts unhurt, because I had a metaphysical clue
to carry off the noxious particles, and let them sink into the earth,
like drops of water. But the English nation are not a nation of
metaphysicians, or they would have detected, and smiled or wept
over the glittering fallacies of this half-bred reasoner, but, at the same
time, most accomplished rhetorician that the world ever saw. But
they are perplexed by sophistry, stupified by prejudice, staggered by
authority. In the way of common sense and practical inquiry, they
do well enough; but start a paradox, and they know not what to
make of it. They either turn from it altogether, or, if interest or fear
give them motives to attend to it, are fascinated by it. They cannot
analyze or separate the true from the <em>seeming</em> good. Mr. Pitt, with his
deep-mouthed <em>common-places</em>, was able to follow in the same track, and
fill up the cry; but he could not have given the tone to political
feeling, or led on the chase with ‘so musical a discord, such sweet;
thunder.’ Burke strewed the flowers of his style over the rotten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>carcase of corruption, and embalmed it in immortal prose: he contrived,
by the force of artful invective and misapplied epithets, to persuade
the people of England that Liberty was an illiberal, hollow sound;
that humanity was a barbarous modern invention, that prejudices were
the test of truth; that reason was a strumpet, and right a fiction. Every
other view of the subject but his (‘so well the tempter glozed’)
seemed to be without attraction, elegance, or refinement. Politics
became poetry in his hands, his sayings passed like proverbs from
mouth to mouth, and his descriptions and similes were admired and
repeated by the fashionable and the fair. Liberty from thenceforward
became a low thing: philosophy was a spring-nailed, velvet-pawed
tyger-cat, with green eyes, watching its opportunity to dart upon its
prey: humanity was a lurking assassin. The emblems of our
cardinal and favourite virtues were overturned: the whole vocabulary
of national watch-words was inverted or displaced. This was a
change indeed in our style of thinking, more alarming than that in
our calendar formerly: and this change was brought about by
Mr. Burke, who softened down hard reasons in the crucible of his
fancy, and who gave to his epithets the force of nicknames. Half
the business was done by his description of the Queen of France.
It was an appeal to all women of quality; to all who were, or
would be thought, cavaliers or men of honour; to all who were
admirers of beauty, or rank, or sex. Yet what it had to do with
the question, it would be difficult to say. If a woman is handsome,
it is well: but it is no reason why she should poison her husband,
or betray a country. If, instead of being young, beautiful, and free
of manners, Marie Antoinette had been old, ugly, and chaste, all
this mischief had been prevented. The author of the Reflections
had seen or dreamt he saw a most delightful vision sixteen years
before, which had thrown his brain into a ferment; and he was
determined to throw his readers and the world into one too. It
was a theme for a copy of verses, or a romance; not for a work in
which the destinies of mankind were to be weighed. Yet she was
the Helen that opened another Iliad of woes; and the world has
paid for that accursed glance at youthful beauty with rivers of blood.
If there was any one of sufficient genius now to deck out some
Castilian maid, or village girl in the Army of the Faith, in all the
colours of fancy, to reflect her image in a thousand ages and hearts,
making a saint and a martyr of her; turning loyalty into religion,
and the rights and liberties of the Spanish nation, and of all other
nations, into a mockery, a bye-word, and a bugbear, how soon would
an end be put to Mr. Canning’s present <em>bizarre</em> (almost afraid to
know itself) situation! How gladly he would turn round on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>pivot of his forced neutrality, and put all his drooping tropes and
figures on their splendid war-establishment again!</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Burke was much of a theatrical man. I do not mean that
his high-wrought enthusiasm or vehemence was not natural to him;
but the direction that he gave to it, was exceedingly capricious and
arbitrary. It was for some time a doubtful question which way he
should turn with respect to the French Revolution, whether for or
against it. His pride took the alarm, that so much had been done
with which he had nothing to do, and that a great empire had been
overturned with his favourite engines, wit and eloquence, while he
had been reforming the ‘turn-spit of the king’s kitchen,’ in set
speeches far superior to the occasion. Rousseau and the Encyclopædists
had lamentably got the start of him; and he was resolved to
drag them back somehow by the heels, and bring what they had
effected to an untimely end,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Undoing all, as all had never been.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The ‘Reflections on the French Revolution’ was a spiteful and
dastard but too successful attempt to <em>put a spoke in the wheels</em> of
knowledge and progressive civilization, and throw them back for
a century and a half at least. In viewing the change, in the
prospects of society, in producing which he had only a slight and
indirect hand by his efforts in the cause of American freedom, he
seemed to say, with Iago in the play,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>‘Though that their joy be joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet will I contrive</div>
      <div class='line'>To throw such changes of vexations on it;</div>
      <div class='line'>As it may lose some colour.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>He went beyond his own most sanguine hopes, but did not live to
witness their final accomplishment, by seeing France literally ‘blotted
out of the map of Europe.’ He died in the most brilliant part of
Buonaparte’s victorious and captain-like campaigns in Italy. If it
could have been foreseen what an ‘ugly customer’ he was likely to
prove, the way would have been to have bribed his vanity (a great
deal stronger than his interest) over to the other side, by asking his
opinion; and, indeed, he has thrown out pretty broad hints in the
early stage of his hostility, and before the unexpected success of the
French arms, and the whizzing arrows flung at him by his old
friends and new antagonists had stung him to madness, that the
great error of the National Assembly was in not having consulted
able and experienced heads on this side the water, as to demolishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>the old, and constructing the new edifice. If he had been employed
to lay the first stone, or to assist, by an inaugural dissertation, at the
baptism of the new French Constitution, the fabric of the Revolution
would thenceforth have risen,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like an exhalation of rich distilled perfumery,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>without let or molestation from his tongue or pen. But he was
overlooked. He was not called from his closet, or from his place
in the House (where, it must be confessed, he was out of his place)
to ‘ride in the whirlwind and direct the storm’; and therefore he
tried, like some malicious hag, to urge the veering gale into a hurricane; to
dash the labouring vessel of the state in pieces, and make
shipwreck of the eternal jewel of man’s happiness, which it had on
board—Liberty. The stores of practical and speculative knowledge
which he had been for years collecting and digesting, and for which
he had no use at home, were not called into play abroad. His
genius had hitherto been always too mighty for the occasion; but
here his utmost grasp of intellect would hardly have been sufficient
to grapple with it. What an opportunity was lost! Something,
therefore, was to be done, to relieve the galling sense of disappointed
ambition and mortified self-consequence. Our political <em>Busy body</em>
turned <em>Marplot</em>; and maliciously, and like a felon, strangled the babe
that he was not professionally called in to swaddle, and dandle, and
bring to maturity. He had his revenge: but so must others have
their’s on his memory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Burke was not an honest man. There was always a <em>dash</em> of
insincerity, a sinister bias in his disposition. We see, from the
letters that passed between him and his two brothers, and Barry
the painter, that there was constantly a balancing of self-interest and
principle in his mind; a thanking of God that he was in no danger
of yielding to temptation, yet as if it were a doubtful or ticklish
point; and a patient, pensive expectation of place and emolument,
till he could reconcile it with integrity and fidelity to his party;
which might easily be construed into a querulous hankering after it,
and an opinion that this temporary self-denial implied a considerable
sacrifice on his part, or that he displayed no small share of virtue in
not immediately turning knave. All this, if narrowly looked into,
has a very suspicious appearance. Burke, with all his capricious
wildness and flighty impulses, was a self-seeker and more constant in
his enmities than in his friendships. He bore malice, and did not
forgive to the last. His cold, sullen behaviour to Fox, who shed
tears when they had a quarrel in the House, and his refusal to see
him afterwards, when the latter came to visit him on his death-bed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>will for ever remain a stigma on his memory. He was, however,
punished for his fault. In his latter writings, he complains bitterly
of the solitariness of his old age, and of the absence of the friends of
his youth—whom he had deserted. This is natural justice, and the
tribute due to apostacy. A man may carry over his own conscience
to the side of his vanity or interest, but he cannot expect, at the
same time, to carry over along with him all those with whom he has
been connected in thought and action, and whose society he will
miss, sooner or later. Mr. Burke could hardly hope to find, in his
casual, awkward, unaccountable intercourse with such men as Pitt or
Dundas, amends for the loss of his old friends, Fox and Sheridan,
to whom he was knit not only by political ties, but by old habitudes,
lengthened recollections, and a variety of common studies and pursuits.
Pitt was a mere politician; Dundas, a mere worldling. What would
they care about him, and his ‘winged words’? <em>No more of talk</em>
about the meetings at Sir Joshua’s—the <i><span lang="la">Noctes cœnæque Deûm</span></i>; about
the fine portraits of that great colourist; about Johnson or Goldsmith,
or Dunning or Barrè; or their early speeches; or the trying times
in the beginning of the American war; or the classic taste and freeborn
spirit of Greece and Rome;—</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps, indeed, he would wish to forget most of these, as ungrateful
topics; but when a man seeks for repose in oblivion of himself, he
had better seek it, where he will soonest find it,—in the grave!
Whatever the talents, or the momentary coincidence of opinion of
his new allies, there would be a want of previous sympathy between
them. Their notions would not amalgamate, or they would not be
sure that they did. Every thing would require to be explained, to
be reconciled. There would be none of the freedom of habitual
intimacy. Friendships, like the clothes we wear, become the easier
from custom. New friendships do not sit well on old or middle age.
Affection is a science, to which it is too late to serve an apprenticeship
after a certain period of life. This is the case with all patched-up,
conventional intimacies; but it is worse when they are built on
inveterate hostility and desertion from an opposite party, where their
naturally crude taste is embittered by jealousy and rankling wounds.
We think to exchange old friends and connections for new ones, and
to be received with an additional welcome for the sacrifice we have
made; but we gain nothing by it but the contempt of those whom
we have left, and the suspicions of those whom we have joined. By
betraying a cause, and turning our backs on a principle, we forfeit
the esteem of the honest, and do not inspire one particle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>confidence or respect in those who may profit by and pay us for
our treachery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Deserters are never implicitly trusted. There is, besides the
sentiment or general principle of the thing, a practical reason for
this. Their zeal, their eagerness to distinguish themselves in their
new career, makes them rash and extravagant; and not only so, but
there is always a leaven of their old principles remaining behind,
which breaks out in spite of themselves, and which it is difficult for
their encouragers and patrons to guard against. This was remarkably
the case with the late Mr. Windham. He was constantly <em>running
a-muck</em> at some question or other, and committing the Ministers. His
old, free-thinking, opposition habits returned upon him before he was
aware of it; and he was sure to hazard some paradox, or stickle
for some objectionable point, contrary to the forms of office. The
cabinet had contemplated no such thing. He was accordingly kept
in check, and alarmed the treasury-bench whenever he rose. He
was like a dog that gives mouth before the time, or is continually
running on a stray scent: he was chid and fed! The same thing is
observable in the present Poet-Laureat, whose jacobinical principles
have taken such deep root in him (<i><span lang="la">intus et in cute</span></i>) that they break
out even in his Court poems, like ‘a thick scurf’ on loyalty; and he
presents them unconsciously, (as an offering of ‘sweet smelling gums,’)
at the very foot of the throne. He at present retains his place
apparently on condition of holding his tongue. He writes such Odes
on kings, that it is next to impossible not to travestie them into
lampoons!</p>

<p class='c007'>The remarks I have made above apply strongly to him and some
of his associates of the <em>Lake School</em>. I fancy he has felt, as much as
anyone, the inconvenience of drawing off from a cause, and that by
so doing we leave our oldest and our best friends behind. There
are those among the favourers and admirers of his youth, whom his
dim eyes discover not, and who do not count his grey hairs. Not
one or two, but more;—men of character and understanding, who
have pledged mutual faith, and drank the cup of freedom with him,
warm from the wine-press, as well as the ‘dews of Castalie.’ He
gave up a principle, and one left him;—he insulted a feeling, and
another fled; he accepted a place, and received the congratulations
of no one but Mr. Croker. He looks round for them in vain,
with throbbing heart, (the heart of a poet can never lie still; he
should take the more care what it is that agitates it!)—sees only the
shadows or the carcases of old friendships; or stretches out his hand
to grasp some new patron, and finds that also cold. If our friends
are sometimes accused of short memories, our enemies make it up by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>having long ones. We had better adhere to the first; for we must
despair of making cordial converts of the last. This double desolation
is cheerless, and makes a man bethink himself. We may make
a shift (a shabby one) without our self-respect; but it will never do
to have it followed by the loss of the respect of those whose opinion
we once valued most. We may tamper with our own consciences;
but we feel at a loss without the testimony of others in our favour,
which is seldom paid, except to integrity of purpose and principle.
Perhaps, however, Mr. Southey consoles himself for a certain void
without and within, by receiving the compliments of some Undergraduate
of either of our Universities, on his last article in defence
of Rotten Boroughs, in the Quarterly Review; or of a Dignitary of
the Church, on his share in the Six Acts, and for suggesting to
Lord Sidmouth the propriety of punishing the second conviction for
libel with banishment. We do not know how this may be: but
with us, it would barb the dart.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would not matter, if these turn-coats were not in such violent
extremes. Between the two, they must be strangely perplexed in
their own minds, and scarcely know what to make of themselves.
They must have singular qualms come over them at times—the
apparitions of former acquaintance and opinions. If they were
contented to correct, to qualify their youthful extravagancies, and
to be taught by experience to steer a middle course, and pay some
deference to the conclusions of others, it would be mighty well;
but this is not their humour. They must be conspicuous, dogmatical,
exclusive, intolerant, on whichever side they are: the mode may be
different, the principle is the same. A man’s nature does not change,
though he may profess different sentiments. A Socinian may become
a Calvinist, or a Whig a Tory: but a bigot is always a bigot; an
egotist never becomes humble. Besides, what excuse has a man,
after thirty, to change about all of a sudden to the very opposite
side? If he is an uneducated man, he may indeed plead ignorance
yesterday of what he has learnt to-day: but a man of study and
reading can’t pretend that a whole host of arguments has suddenly
burst upon him, of which he never heard before, and that they have
upset all his earlier notions: he must have known them long before,
and if they made no impression on him then to modify his violent
zeal (supposing them to be right now) it is a sign either of a
disinclination, or of an incapacity, on his part, to give truth a fair
hearing—a bad ground to build his present dogmatical and infallible
tone upon! It is certain, that the common sense of the world condemns
these violent changes of opinion; and if they do not prove that a man
prefers his convenience to his virtue, they at least show that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>prefers it to his reputation; for he loses his character by them. An
apostate is a name that all men abhor, that no man ever willingly
acknowledges; and the tergiversation which it denotes is not likely
to come into much greater request, till it is no longer observed that
a man seldom changes his principles except for his interest! Those
who go over from the winning to the losing side, do not incur this
appellation; and however we may count them fools, they can’t be
called knaves into the bargain.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>QUERIES AND ANSWERS; OR THE RULE OF CONTRARY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The London Weekly Review.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>November 17, 1827.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>1. Why is the word <em>comfort</em> so continually in the mouths of the
English?—Because the English are the most uncomfortable of all
people: for being so liable to receive pain from outward objects, and
being made uneasy by everything that is not as they wish it, they are
obliged to remove, if possible, every source of annoyance, and have
<em>all their comforts about them</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Why are the English so fond of clubs, corporate bodies, joint-stock
companies, and large associations of all kinds?—Because they
are the most unsociable set of people in the world: for being mostly
at variance with each other, they are glad to get any one else to join
and be on their side; having no spontaneous attraction, they are
forced to fasten themselves into the machine of society; and each
holds out in his individual shyness and reserve, till he is carried away
by the crowd, and borne with a violent, but welcome shock against
some other mass of aggregate prejudice or self-interest. The English
join together to get rid of their sharp points and sense of uncomfortable
peculiarity. Hence, their clubs, their mobs, their sects, their
parties, their spirit of co-operation, and previous understanding in
every thing. An English mob is a collection of violent and headstrong
humours, acting with double force from each man’s natural
self-will, and the sense of opposition to others; and the same may be
said of the nation at large. The French unite and separate more
easily; and therefore do not collect into such formidable masses, and
act with such unity and tenacity of purpose. It is the same with
their ideas, which easily join together, and easily part company; but
do not form large or striking masses: and hence, the French are full
of wit and fancy, but without imagination and principle. The French
are governed by fashion, the English by cabal.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>3. Why are the English a credulous nation, and the eager dupes of
all sorts of quacks and impostors?—Because they are a dry, plodding,
<em>matter-of-fact</em> people, and having, in general, no idea of the possibility
of telling lies, think all they hear or read must be true, and are left at
the mercy of every empiric or knavish pretender, who will take the
trouble to impose on them. From their very gravity and seriousness,
they are the dupes of superficial professions and appearances, which
they think, (judging from themselves,) must imply all they pretend.
Their folly and love of the marvellous takes a practical and mischievous
turn; they despise the fictitious, and require to be amused
by something that they think solid and useful. Hence, they swallow
Dr. Brodum’s pills, Joanna Southcote’s prophecies, the Literary
Gazette, and Blackwood’s Magazine, taking them all for gospel.
They constantly have a succession of idols or bugbears. There is
always some one to be hunted down at the time for their amusement,
like a strange dog in a village; and some name, some work that is
cried up for half-a-dozen years, as containing all wisdom, and then
you hear no more of it. No people judge so much as the English at
second-hand, except in mere matters of pounds, shillings, and pence;
and even then they may be gulled by impudence and quackery.
Every thing is either in collusion or collision. <em>Thimble</em> was a great
man in the O. P. Row, and now regulates the debates in Parliament.
If a man has a monstrous good opinion of himself, and nothing will
drive him out of it, the English will come into his way of thinking,
sooner than be left in a <em>minority</em>, or not appear to be in the secret!
Lest they should seem stupid, they try to be <em>knowing</em>, as they become
forward in aiming to be witty, and vulgar in affecting to be genteel.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>ON KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The London Weekly Review.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>December 1, 1827.</em></span></p>

<p class='c014'>‘Who shall go about to cozen fortune, or wear the badge of honour without the
stamp of merit?’</p>

<p class='c006'>A knowledge of the world is generally supposed to be the fruit of
experience and observation, or of a various, practical acquaintance
with men and things. On the contrary, it appears to me to be a
kind of instinct, arising out of a peculiar construction and turn of
mind. Some persons display this knowledge at their first outset in
life: others, with all their opportunities and dear-bought lessons,
never acquire it to the end of their career. In fact, a knowledge of
the world only means a knowledge of our own interest; it is nothing but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>a species of selfishness or ramification of the law of self-preservation.
There may be said to be two classes of people in the world, which
remain for ever distinct: those who consider things in the abstract, or
with a reference to the truth, and those who consider them only
with a reference to themselves, or to the <em>main-chance</em>. The first,
whatever may be their acquirements or discoveries, wander through
life in a sort of absence of mind, or comparative state of sleep-walking:
the last, though their attention is riveted to a single point of view, are
always on the alert, know perfectly well what they are about, and
calculate with the greatest nicety the effect which their words or
actions will have on others. They do not trouble themselves about
the arguments on any subject: they know the opinion entertained on
it, and that is enough for them to regulate themselves by; the rest they
regard as quite Utopian, and foreign to the purpose. ‘Subtle as the fox
for prey, like warlike as the wolf for what they eat,’ they leave mere
speculative points to those who, from some unaccountable bias or
caprice take an interest in what does not personally concern them,
and make good the old saying, that ‘the children of the world are
wiser in their generation than the children of the light!’</p>

<p class='c007'>The man of the world is to the man of science very much what the
chamelion is to the armadillo: the one takes its hue from every
surrounding object, and is undistinguishable from them; the other is
shut up in a formal crust of knowledge, and clad in an armour of
proof, from which the shaft of ridicule or the edge of disappointment
falls equally pointless. It is no uncommon case to see a person come
into a room, which he enters awkwardly enough, and has nothing in his
dress or appearance to recommend him, but after the first embarrassments
are over, sits down, takes his share in the conversation, in
which he acquits himself creditably, shews sense, reading, and
shrewdness, expresses himself with point, articulates distinctly, when
he blunders on some topic which he might see is disagreeable, but
persists in it the more as he finds others shrink from it; mentions a
book of which you have not heard, and perhaps do not wish to
hear, and he therefore thinks himself bound to favour you with the
contents; gets into an argument with one, proses on with another on
a subject in which his hearer has no interest; and when he goes away,
people remark, ‘What a pity that Mr. —— has not more knowledge
of the world, and has so little skill in adapting himself to the
tone and manners of society!’ But will time and habit cure him of
this defect? Never. He wants a certain <em>tact</em>, he has not a voluntary
power over his ideas, but is like a person reading out of a book, or
who can only pour out the budget of knowledge with which his brain
is crammed in all places and companies alike. If you attempt to divert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>his attention from the general subject to the persons he is addressing,
you puzzle and stop him quite. He is a mere conversing automaton.
He has not the <em>sense of personality</em>—the faculty of perceiving the
effect (as well as the grounds) of his opinions; and how then should
failure or mortification give it him? It must be a painful reflection,
and he must be glad to turn from it; or after a few reluctant and
unsuccessful efforts to correct his errors, he will try to forget or
harden himself in them. Finding that he makes so slow and imperceptible
a progress in amending his faults, he will take his swing in
the opposite direction, will triumph and revel in his supposed excellences,
will launch out into the wide, untrammelled field of abstract
speculation, and silence envious sneers and petty cavils by force of
argument and dint of importunity. You will find him the same
character at sixty that he was at thirty; or should time soften down
some of his asperities, and tire him of his absurdities as he has tired
others, nothing will transform him into a man of the world, and he
will die in a garret, or a paltry second-floor, from not having been able
to acquire the art ‘to see ourselves as others see us,’ or to dress his
opinions, looks, and actions in the smiles and approbation of the
world. On the other hand, take a youth from the same town
(perhaps a school-fellow, and the dunce of the neighbourhood); he
has ‘no figures, nor no fantasies which busy thought draws in the brains
of men,’ no preconceived notions by which he must square his conduct
or his conversation, no dogma to maintain in the teeth of opposition,
no Shibboleth to which he must force others to subscribe;
the progress of science or the good of his fellow-creatures are things
about which he has not the remotest conception, or the smallest
particle of anxiety—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘His soul proud science never taught to stray</div>
      <div class='line'>Far as the solar walk, or milky way;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>all that he sees or attends to is the immediate path before him, or
what can encourage or lend him a helping hand through it; his mind
is a complete blank, on which the world may write its maxims and
customs in what characters it pleases; he has only to study its
humours, flatter its prejudices, and take advantage of its foibles;
while walking the streets he is not taken up with solving an abstruse
problem, but with considering his own and the appearance of others;
instead of contradicting a patron, assents to all he hears; and in every
proposition that comes before him asks himself only what he can get
by it, and whether it will make him friends or enemies: such a one is
said to possess great penetration and knowledge of the world, understands
his place in society, gets on in it, rises from the counter to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>counting-house, from the dependant to be a partner, amasses a fortune,
gains in size and respectability as his affairs prosper, has his town
and country house, and ends with buying up half the estates in his
native county!</p>

<p class='c007'>The great secret of a knowledge of the world, then, consists in a
subserviency to the will of others, and the primary motive to this
attention is a mechanical and watchful perception of our own interest.
It is not an art that requires a long course of study, the difficulty is in
putting one’s self apprentice to it. It does not surely imply any very
laborious or profound inquiry into the distinctions of truth or
falsehood, to be able to assent to whatever one hears; nor any great
refinement of moral feeling, to approve of whatever has custom,
power, or interest on its side. The only question is, ‘Who is
willing to do so?’—and the answer is, those who have no other
faculties or pretensions, either to stand in the way of or to assist their
progress through life. Those are slow to wear the livery of the
world who have any independent resources of their own. It is not
that the philosopher or the man of genius does not see and know all
this, that he is not constantly and forcibly reminded of it by his own
failure or the success of others, but he cannot stoop to practice it. He
has a different scale of excellence and mould of ambition, which has
nothing in common with current maxims and time-serving calculations.
He is a moral and intellectual egotist, not a mere worldly-minded
one. In youth, he has sanguine hopes and brilliant dreams,
which he cannot sacrifice for sordid realities—as he advances farther
in life, habit and pride forbid his turning back. He cannot bring
himself to give up his best-grounded convictions to a blockhead, or his
conscientious principles to a knave, though he might make his fortune
by so doing. The rule holds good here as well as in another sense—‘What
shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his
own soul?’ If his convictions and principles had been less strong,
they would have yielded long ago to the suggestions of his interest,
and he would have relapsed into the man of the world, or rather he
would never have had the temptation or capacity to be any thing else.
One thing that keeps men honest, as well as that confirms them
knaves, is their incapacity to do any better for themselves than
nature has done for them. One person can with difficulty speak the
truth, as another lies with a very ill grace. After repeated awkward
attempts to change characters, they each very properly fall
back into their old <em>jog-trot</em> path, as best suited to their genius and
habits.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are individuals who make themselves and every one else
uncomfortable by trying to be agreeable, and who are only to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>endured in their natural characters of blunt, plain-spoken people.
Many a man would have turned rogue if he had known how. <i><span lang="la">Non
ex quovis ligno fit Mercurius.</span></i> The modest man cannot be impudent
if he would. The man of sense cannot play the fool to advantage.
It is not the mere resolution to act a part that will enable us to do it,
without a natural genius and fitness for it. Some men are born to be
valets, as others are to be courtiers. There is the climbing <em>genus</em> in
man as well as in plants. It is sometimes made a wonder how men of
‘no mark or likelihood’ frequently rise to court-preferment, and make
their way against all competition. That is the very reason. They
present no tangible point; they offend no feeling of self-importance.
They are a perfect unresisting medium of patronage and favour.
They aspire through servility; they repose in insignificance. A man
of talent or pretension in the same circumstances would be kicked out
in a week. A look that implied a doubt, a hint that suggested a
difference of opinion, would be fatal. It is of no use, in parleying
with absolute power, to dissemble, to suppress: there must be no feelings
or opinions to dissemble or suppress. The artifice of the dependant
is not a match for the jealousy of the patron: ‘The soul must be
subdued to the very quality of its lord.’ Where all is annihilated in
the presence of the sovereign, is it astonishing that <em>nothings</em> should
succeed? Ciphers are as necessary in courts as eunuchs in seraglios.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The London Weekly Review.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>December 8, 1827</em>,</span></p>

<p class='c006'>I do not think Mr. Cobbett would succeed in an interview with
the Prince. Bub Doddington said, ‘he would not justify before his
Sovereign,’ even where his own character was at stake. I am afraid
we could hardly reckon upon the same forbearance in Mr. Cobbett
where his country’s welfare was at stake, and where he had an
opportunity of vindicating it. He might have a great deal of reason
on his side; but he might forget, or seem to forget, that as the king
is above the law, he is also above reason. Reason is but a suppliant
at the foot of thrones, and waits for their approval or rebuke. <em>Salus
populi suprema lex</em>—may be a truism anywhere else. If reason dares
to approach them at all, it must be in the shape of deference and
humility, not of headstrong importunity and self-will. Instead of
breathless awe, of mild entreaty, of humble remonstrance, it is Mr.
Cobbett, who, upon very slight encouragement, would give the law,
and the monarch who must kiss the rod. The upstart, the bully,
and the dogmatist, would break out, and the King would assert himself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>The reformer would be too full of his own opinion to allow an
option even to Majesty, and the affair would have the same ending as
that of the old ballad—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Then the Queen overhearing what Betty did say,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would send Mr. Roper to take her away.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As I have brought Mr. Cobbett in here by the neck and shoulders,
I may add that I do not think he belongs properly to the class, either
of philosophical speculators, or men of the world. He is a political
humourist. He is too much taken up with himself either to attend
to right reason, or to judge correctly of what passes around him. He
mistakes strength of purpose and passion, not only for truth but for
success. Because he can give fifty good reasons for a thing, he thinks
it not only <em>ought</em> to be, but <em>must</em> be. Because he is swayed so entirely
by his wishes and humours, he believes others will be ready to give
up their prejudices, interests, and resentments to oblige him. He
persuades himself that he is the fittest person to represent Westminster
in parliament, and he considers this point (once proved)
tantamount to his return. He knows no more of the disposition or
sentiments of the people of Westminster than of the inhabitants of the
moon (except from what he himself chooses to say or write of them),
and it is this want of sympathy which, as much as anything, prevents
his being chosen. The exclusive force and bigotry of his opinions
deprives them of half their influence and effect, by allowing no toleration
to others, and consequently setting them against him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Cobbett seemed disappointed, at one time, at not succeeding in
the character of a legacy-hunter. Why, a person to succeed in this
character, ought to be a mere skin or bag to hold money, a place to
deposit it in, a shadow, a deputy, a trustee who keeps it for the
original owner—so that the transfer is barely nominal, and who, if
he were to return from the other world, would modestly yield it
up—one who has no personal identity of his own, no will to encroach
upon or dispose of it otherwise than his patron would wish after his
death—not a hair-brained egotist, a dashing adventurer, to squander,
hector and flourish away with it in wild schemes and ruinous experiments,
every one of them at variance with the opinions of the testator;
in new methods of turnip hoeing; in speculations in madder—this
would be to tear his soul from his body twice over—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Cobbett complained, that in his last interview with Baron
Mazeres, that gentleman was in his dotage, and that the reverend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>legatee sat at the bottom of the table, cutting a poor figure, and not
contradicting a word the Baron said. No doubt, as he has put this
in print in the exuberance of his dissatisfaction, he let both gentlemen
see pretty plainly what he thought of them, and fancied that this
expression of his contempt, as it gratified him, was the way to
ensure the good will of the one to make over his whole estate,
or the good word of the other to let him <em>go snacks</em>. This is a new
way of being <em>quits</em> with one’s benefactors, and an egregious <em>quid
pro quo</em>. If Baron Mazeres had left Mr. Cobbett 200,000<em>l.</em> it
must have been not to write his epitaph, or visit him in his last
moments!</p>

<p class='c007'>A gossiping chambermaid who only smiles and assents when her
mistress wishes her to talk, or an ignorant country clown who stands
with his hat off when he has a favour to ask of the squire, (and if he
is wise, at all other times,) knows more of the matter. A knowledge
of mankind is little more than the Scotch instinct of <em>bowing</em>, or of
‘never standing upright in the presence of a great man,’ or of that
great blockhead, the world. It is not a perception of truth, but a
sense of power, and an instant determination of the will to submit to
it. It is therefore less an intellectual acquirement than a natural
disposition. It is on this account that I think both cunning and
wisdom are a sort of original endowments, or attain maturity much
earlier than is supposed, from their being moral qualities, and having
their seat in the heart rather than the head. The difference depends
on the <em>manner</em> of seeing things. The one is a selfish, the other is a disinterested
view of nature. The one is the clear open look of integrity,
the other is a contracted and blear-eyed obliquity of mental vision.
If any one has but the courage and honesty to look at an object as it is
in itself, or divested of prejudice, fear, and favour, he will be sure
to see it pretty right; as he who regards it through the refractions of
opinion and fashion, will be sure to see it distorted and falsified, however
the error may rebound to his own advantage. Certainly, he who
makes the universe tributary to his convenience, and subjects all his
impressions of what is right or wrong, true or false, black or white,
round or square, to the standard and maxims of the world, who never
utters a proposition but he fancies a patron close at his elbow who
overhears him, who is even afraid, in private, to suffer an honest
conviction to rise in his mind, lest it should mount to his lips, get wind,
and ruin his prospects in life, ought to gain something in exchange
for the restraint and force put upon his thoughts and faculties: on
the contrary, he who is confined by no such petty and debasing
trammels, whose comprehension of mind is ‘in large heart enclosed,’
finds his inquiries and his views expand in a degree commensurate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>with the universe around him; makes truth welcome wherever he
meets her, and receives her cordial embrace in return. To see things
divested of passion and interest, is to see them with the eye of history
and philosophy. It is easy to judge right, or at least to come to a
mutual understanding in matters of history and abstract morality. Why
then is it so difficult to arrive at the same calm certainty in actual
life? Because the passions and interests are concerned, and it
requires so much more candour, love of truth, and independence of
spirit to encounter ‘the world and its dread laugh,’ to throw aside
every sinister consideration, and grapple with the plain merits of the
case. To be wiser than other men is to be honester than they; and
strength of mind is only courage to see and speak the truth. Perhaps
the courage may be also owing to the strength; but both go together,
and are natural, and not acquired. Do we not see in fables the force
of the moral principle in detecting the truth? The only effect of fables
is, by making inanimate or irrational things actors in the scene, to
remove the case completely from our own sphere, to take our self-love
off its guard, to simplify the question; and yet the result of this obvious
appeal is allowed to be universal and irresistible. Is not this another
example that ‘the heart of man is deceitful above all things;’ or,
that it is less our incapacity to distinguish what is right, than our
secret determination to adhere to what is wrong, that prevents our
discriminating one from the other? It is not that great and useful truths
are not manifest and discernible in themselves; but little, dirty objects
get between them and us, and from being near and gross, hide the lofty
and distant! The first business of the patriot and the philanthropist is
to overleap this barrier, to rise out of this material dross. Indignation,
contempt of the base and grovelling, makes the philosopher no less
than the poet; and it is the power of looking beyond self that enables
each to inculcate moral truth and nobleness of sentiment, the one by
general precepts, the other by individual example.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have no quarrel with men of the world, mere <em>muck-worms</em>:
every one after his fashion, ‘as the flesh and fortune shall serve;’
but I confess I have a little distaste to those, who, having set out as
loud and vaunting enthusiasts, have turned aside to ‘tread the
primrose path of dalliance,’ and to revile those who did not choose
to follow so edifying an example. The candid brow and elastic
spring of youth may be exchanged for the wrinkles and crookedness
of age; but at least we should retain something of the erectness and
openness of our first unbiassed thoughts. I cannot understand how
any degree of egotism can dispense with the consciousness of personal
identity. As we advance farther in life, we are naturally inclined to
revert in imagination to its commencement; but what can those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>dwell upon there who find only feelings that they despise, and
opinions that they have abjured? ‘If thine eye offend thee, pull
it out and cast it from thee:’ but the operation is a painful one,
and the body remains after it only a mutilated fragment. Generally,
those who are cut off from this resource in former recollections,
make up for it (as well as they can) by an exaggerated and uxorious
fondness for their late-espoused convictions—a thing unsightly and
indecent! Why does he, who, at one time, despises ‘the little
chapel-bell,’ afterwards write ‘the Book of the Church?’ The one
is not an atonement for the other: each shows only a juvenile or a
superannuated precocity of judgment. It is uniting Camille-Desmoulins
and Camille-Jourdan, (<em>Jourdan of the Chimes</em>) in one character. I
should like (not out of malice, but from curiosity) to see Mr.
Southey re-write the beautiful poem on ‘his own miniature-picture,
when he was two years old,’ and see what he would substitute for
the lines—</p>

      <div class='line in14'>‘And it was thought,</div>

<p class='c007'>There must here, I think, be <em>hiatus in manuscriptis</em>: the verse
must halt a little! The laureate and his friends say that they are
still labouring on the same design as ever, correcting the outlines and
filling up the unfinished sketch of their early opinions. They seem
rather to have blotted them quite out, and to have taken a fresh
canvas to begin another and no less extravagant caricature. Or
their new and old theories remind one of those heads in picturedealers’
shops, where one half of the face is thoroughly cleaned and
repaired, and the other left covered with stains and dirt, to show
the necessity of the picture-scourer’s art: the transition offends the
sight. It may be made a question whether men grow wiser as
they grow older, any more than they grow stronger or healthier
or honester. They may, in one sense, imbibe a greater portion of
worldly wisdom, and have their romantic flights tamed to the level
of every day’s practice and experience; but perhaps it would be
better if some of the extravagance and enthusiasm of youth could be
infused into the latter, instead of being absorbed (perforce) in that
sink of pride, envy, selfishness, ignorance, conceit, prejudice, and
hypocrisy. One thing is certain, that this is the present course of
events, and that if the individual grows wiser as he gains experience,
the world does not, and that the tardy penitent who is treading back
his steps, may meet the world advancing as he is retreating, and
adopting more and more of the genuine impulses and disinterested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>views of youth into its creed. It is, indeed, only by conforming to
some such original and unsophisticated standard, that it can acquire
either soundness or consistency. The appeal is a fair one, from the
bad habits of society to the unprejudiced aspirations and impressions
of human nature.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The London Weekly Review.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>December 15, 1827.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>It seems, in truth, a hard case to have all the world against us, and
to require uncommon fortitude (not to say presumption) to stand
out single against such a host. The bare suggestion must ‘give us
pause,’ and has no doubt overturned many an honest conviction.
The <em>opinion of the world</em>, (as it pompously entitles itself,) if it means
anything more than a set of local and party prejudices, with which
only our interest, not truth, is concerned, is a shadow, a bugbear,
and a contradiction in terms. <em>Having all the world against us</em>, is a
phrase without a meaning; for in those points in which all the
world agree, no one differs from the world. If all the world were
of the same way of thinking, and always kept in the same mind, it
would certainly be a little staggering to have them against you. But
however widely and angrily they may differ from you, they differ
as much so from one another, and even from themselves. What
is gospel at one moment, is heresy the next:—different countries and
climates have different notions of things. When you are put on your
trial, therefore, for impugning the public opinion, you may always
<em>subpœna</em> this great body against itself. For example, I have been
twitted for somewhere calling Tom Paine a great writer, and no
doubt his reputation at present ‘does somewhat smack:’ yet in 1792
he was so great, or so popular an author, and so much read and
admired by numbers who would not now mention his name, that the
Government was obliged to suspend the Constitution, and to go to
war to counteract the effects of his popularity. His extreme popularity
was then the cause (by a common and vulgar <em>reaction</em>) of his
extreme obnoxiousness. If the opinion of the world, then, contradicts
itself, why may not I contradict it, or choose at what time,
and to what extent I will agree with it? I have been accused of
abusing dissenters, and saying that sectaries, in general, are dry and
suspicious; and I believe that all the world will say the same thing
except themselves. I have said that the church people are proud
and overbearing, which has given them umbrage, though in this I
have all the sectaries on my side. I have laughed at the Methodists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>and for this I have been accused of glancing at religion: yet
who does not laugh at the Methodists as well as myself? But
I also laugh at those who laugh at them. I have pointed out by
turns the weak sides and foibles of different sects and parties, and
they themselves maintain that they are perfect and infallible: and
this is what is called having all the world against me. I have
inveighed all my life against the insolence of the Tories, and for
this I have the authority both of Whigs and Reformers; but then
I have occasionally spoken against the imbecility of the Whigs,
and the extravagance of the Reformers, and thus have brought all
three on my back, though two out of the three regularly agree with
all I say of the third party. Poets do not approve of what I have
said of their turning prose-writers; nor do the politicians approve of
my tolerating the fooleries of the fanciful tribe at all: so they make
common cause to <em>damn</em> me between them. People never excuse the
drawbacks from themselves, nor the concessions to an adversary:
such is the justice and candour of mankind! Mr. Wordsworth is
not satisfied with the praise I have heaped upon himself, and still
less, that I have allowed Mr. Moore to be a poet at all. I do not
think I have ever set my face against the popular idols of the day;
I have been among the foremost in crying up Mrs. Siddons, Kean,
Sir Walter Scott, Madame Pasta, and others; and as to the great
names of former times, my admiration has been lavish, and sometimes
almost mawkish. I have dissented, it is true, in one or two
instances; but that only shows that I judge for myself, not that I
make a point of contradicting the general taste. I have been more
to blame in trying to push certain Illustrious Obscure into notice:—they
have not forgiven the obligation, nor the world the tacit
reproach. As to my personalities, they might quite as well be
termed <em>impersonalities</em>. I am so intent on the abstract proposition
and its elucidation, that I regard everything else as of very subordinate
consequence: my friends, I conceive, will not refuse to contribute
to so laudable an undertaking, and my enemies <em>must</em>! I have found
fault with the French, I have found fault with the English; and
pray, do they not find great, mutual, and just fault with one
another? It may seem a great piece of arrogance in any one, to
set up his individual and private judgment against that of ten millions
of people; but cross the channel, and you will have thirty millions
on your side. Even should the thirty millions come over to the
opinions of the ten, (a thing that may happen to-morrow,) still one
need not despair. I remember my old friend Peter Finnerty,
laughing very heartily at something I had written about the Scotch,
but it was followed up by a sketch of the Irish, on which he closed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>the book, looked grave, and said he disapproved entirely of all
national reflections. Thus you have all the world on your side,
except when it is the party concerned. What any set of people
think or say of themselves is hardly a rule for others: yet, if you
do not attach yourself to some one set of people and principles, and
stick to them through thick and thin, instead of giving your opinion
fairly and fully all round, you must expect to have all the world
against you, for no other reason than because you express sincerely,
and <em>for their good</em>, not only what they say of others, but what is said
of themselves, which they would fain keep a profound secret, and
prevent the divulging of it under the severest pains and penalties.
When I told J—— that I had composed a work in which I had
‘in some sort handled’ about a score of leading characters, he said,
‘Then you will have one man against you, and the remaining
nineteen for you!’ I have not found it so. In fact, these persons
would agree pretty nearly to all that I say, and allow that, in
nineteen points out of twenty, I am right; but the twentieth, that
relates to some imperfection of their own, weighs down all the rest,
and produces an unanimous verdict against the author. There is but
one thing in which the world agree, a certain bigoted blindness, and
conventional hypocrisy, without which, according to Mandeville,
(that is, if they really spoke what they thought and knew of
one another,) they would fall to cutting each other’s throats
immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>We find the same contrariety and fluctuation of opinion in different
ages, as well as countries and classes. For about a thousand years,
during ‘the high and palmy state’ of the Romish hierarchy, it was
agreed (<em>nemine contradicente</em>) that <em>two and two made five</em>: afterwards,
for above a century, there was great battling and controversy to prove
that they made four and a half; then, for a century more, it was
thought a great stride taken to come down to four and a quarter; and,
perhaps, in another century or two, it will be discovered for a wonder
that <em>two and two actually make four</em>! It is said, that this slow advance
and perpetual interposition of impediments is a salutary check to the
rashness of innovation, and to hazardous experiments. At least, it is
a very effectual one, amounting almost to a prohibition. One age
is employed in building up an absurdity, and the next exhausts all
its wit and learning, zeal and fury, in battering it down, so that at the
end of two generations you come to the point where you set out, and
have to begin again. These heats and disputes about external points
of faith may be things of no consequence, since under all the variations
of form or doctrine the essentials of practice remain the same. It
does not seem so; at any rate, the non-essentials appear to excite all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>the interest, and ‘keep this dreadful pudder o’er our heads;’ and
when the dogma is once stripped of mystery and intolerance, and
reduced to common sense, no one appears to take any further notice
of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appeal, then, to the authority of the world, chiefly resolves
itself into the old proverb, that ‘when you are at Rome you must
do as those at Rome do;’ that is, it is a shifting circle of local
prejudices and gratuitous assumptions, a successful conformity to which
is best insured by a negation of all other qualities that might interfere
with it: solid reason and virtue are out of the question. But it may
be insisted, that there are qualities of a more practical order that may
greatly contribute to and facilitate our advancement in life, such as
presence of mind, convivial talents, insight into character, thorough
acquaintance with the profounder principles and secret springs of
society, and so forth. I do not deny that all this may be of advantage
in extraordinary cases, and often abridge difficulties; but I do not think
that it is either necessary or generally useful. For instance, habitual
caution and reserve is a surer resource than that presence of mind, or
quick-witted readiness of expedient, which, though it gets men out of
scrapes, as often leads them into them by begetting a false confidence.
Persons of agreeable and lively talents often find to their cost that one
indiscretion procures them more enemies then ten agreeable sallies do
friends. A too great penetration into character is less desirable than
a certain power of hoodwinking ourselves to their defects, unless the
former is accompanied with a profound hypocrisy, which is also liable
to detection and discomfiture: and as to general maxims and principles
of worldly knowledge, I conceive that an instinctive sympathy with
them is much more profitable than their incautious discovery and
formal announcement. Thus, the politic rule, ‘When a great wheel
goes up a hill, cling fast to it; when a great wheel runs down a hill,
let go your hold of it,’ may be useful as a hint or warning to the
shyness or fidelity of an Englishman; a North Briton feels its truth
instinctively, and acts upon it unconsciously. When it is observed in
the <em>History of a Foundling</em>, that ‘Mr. Alworthy had done so many
charitable actions that he had made enemies of the whole parish,’ the
sarcasm is the dictate of a generous indignation at ingratitude rather
than a covert apology for selfish niggardliness. Misanthropic reflections
have their source in philanthropic sentiments; the real despiser
of the world keeps up appearances with it, and is at pains to varnish
over its vices and follies, even to himself, lest his secret should be
betrayed, and do him an injury. Those who see completely into the
world begin to play tricks with it, and overreach themselves by being
too knowing: it is even possible to <em>out-cant</em> it, and get laughed at that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>way. Fielding knew something of the world, yet he did not make a
fortune. Sir Walter Scott has twice made a fortune by descriptions
of nature and character, and has twice lost it by the same fondness for
speculative gains. Wherever there is a strong faculty for anything,
the exercise of that faculty becomes its own end and reward, and
produces an indifference or inattention to other things; so that the
best security for success in the world is an incapacity for success in
any other way. A bookseller to succeed in his business should have
no knowledge of books, except as marketable commodities: the
instant he has a taste, an opinion of his own on the subject, he may
consider himself as a ruined man. In like manner, a picture-dealer
should know nothing of pictures but the catalogue price, the cant of
the day. The moment he has a feeling for the art, he will be tenacious
of it: a Guido, a Salvator ‘will be the fatal Cleopatra for which
he will lose all he is worth, and be content to lose it.’ Should a
general then know nothing of war, a physician of medicine? No:
because this is an art and not a trick, and the one has to contend with
nature, and the other with an enemy, and not to pamper or cajole the
follies of the world. It requires also great talents to overturn the
world; not, to push one’s fortune in it: to rule the state like
Cromwell or Buonaparte; not, to rise in it like Castlereagh or
Croker. Yet, even in times of crisis and convulsion, he who outrages
the feeling of the moment and echoes the wildest extravagance,
succeeds; as, in times of peace and tranquillity, he does so who
acquiesces most tamely in the ordinary routine of things. This may
serve to point out another error, common to men of the world, who
sometimes, giving themselves credit for more virtue than they possess,
declare very candidly that if they had to begin life over again, they
would have been <em>great rogues</em>. The answer to this is, that then they
would have been <em>hanged</em>! No: the way to get on in the world is to
be neither more nor less wise, neither better nor worse than your
neighbours, neither to be a ‘reformer nor a house-breaker,’ neither to
advance before the age nor lag behind it, but to be as like it as
possible, to reflect its image and superscription at every turn, and then
you will be its darling and its delight, and it will dandle you and
fondle you, and make much of you, as a monkey doats upon its young!
The knowledge of vice—that is, of <em>statutable</em> vice—is not the knowledge
of the world: otherwise a Bow-street runner and the keeper of a
house of ill fame, would be the most knowing characters, and would
soon rise above their professions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Once asking a friend why he did not bring forward an explanation of
a circumstance, in which his conduct had been called in question, he
said, ‘His friends were satisfied on the subject, and he cared very
little about the opinion of the world.’ I made answer that I did not
consider this a good ground to rest his defence upon, for that a man’s
friends seldom thought better of him than the world did. I see no
reason to alter this opinion. Our friends, indeed, are more apt than
a mere stranger to join in with, or be silent under any imputation
thrown out against us, because they are apprehensive they may be
indirectly implicated in it, and they are bound to betray us to save
their own credit. To judge of our jealousy, our sensibility, our high
notions of responsibility on this score, only consider if a single individual
lets fall a solitary remark implying a doubt of the wit, the
sense, the courage of a friend,—how it staggers us—how it makes us
shake with fear—how it makes us call up all our eloquence and airs
of self-consequence in his defence, lest our partiality should be supposed
to have blinded our perceptions, and we should be regarded as
the dupes of a mistaken admiration. We already begin to meditate
an escape from a losing cause, and try to find out some other fault in
the character under discussion, to show that we are not behind-hand
(if the truth must be spoken) in sagacity, and a sense of the ridiculous.
If, then, this is the case with the first flaw, the first doubt, the first
speck that dims the sun of friendship, so that we are ready to turn
our backs on our sworn attachment and well-known professions the
instant we have not all the world with us, what must it be when
we have all the world against us; when our friend, instead of a
single stain, is covered with mud from head to foot; how shall we
expect our feeble voices not to be drowned in the general clamour?
how shall we dare to oppose our partial and mis-timed suffrages to
the just indignation of the public? Or if it should not amount to
this, how shall we answer the silence and contempt with which his
name is received? how shall we animate the great mass of indifference
or distrust with our private enthusiasm? how defeat the involuntary
smile, or the suppressed sneer, with the burst of generous feeling
and the glow of honest conviction? It is a thing not to be thought
of, unless we would enter into a crusade against prejudice and malignity,
devote ourselves as martyrs to friendship, raise a controversy in
every company we go into, quarrel with every person we meet, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>after making ourselves and everyone else uncomfortable, leave off, not
by clearing our friend’s reputation, but by involving our own pretensions
to decency and common sense. People will not fail to observe,
that a man may have his reasons for his faults or vices; but that for
another to volunteer a defence of them, is without excuse. It is, in
fact, an attempt to deprive them of the great and only benefit they
derive from the supposed errors of their neighbours and contemporaries—the
pleasure of backbiting and railing at them, which they
call <em>seeing justice done</em>. It is not a single breath of rumour or opinion;
but the whole atmosphere is infected with a sort of aguish taint of
anger and suspicion, that relaxes the nerves of fidelity, and makes our
most sanguine resolutions sicken and turn pale; and he who is proof
against it, must either be armed with a love of truth, or a contempt
for mankind, which place him out of the reach of ordinary rules and
calculations. For myself, I do not shrink from defending a cause
or a friend <em>under a cloud</em>; though in neither case will cheap or
common efforts suffice. But, in the first, you merely stand up for
your own judgment and principles against fashion and prejudice, and
thus assume a sort of manly and heroic attitude of defiance: in the
last, (which makes it a matter of greater nicety and nervous sensibility,)
you sneak behind another to throw your gauntlet at the whole
world, and it requires a double stock of stoical firmness not to be
laughed out of your boasted zeal and independence as a romantic and
<em>amiable weakness</em>.<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c008'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is nothing in which all the world agree but in running down
some obnoxious individual. It may be supposed, that this is not for
nothing, and that they have good reasons for what they do. On the
contrary, I will undertake to say, that so far from there being invariably
just grounds for such an universal outcry, the universality of the
outcry is often the only ground of the opinion; and that it is purposely
raised upon this principle, that all other proof or evidence
against the person meant to be run down is wanting. Nay, farther,
it may happen, while the clamour is at the loudest; while you hear
it from all quarters; while it blows a perfect hurricane; while ‘the
world rings with the vain stir’—not one of those who are most eager
in hearing and echoing it knows what it is about, or is not fully persuaded,
that the charge is equally false, malicious, and absurd. It is
like the wind, that ‘no man knoweth whence it cometh, or whither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>it goeth.’ It is <em>vox et praeterea nihil</em>. What then is it that gives it
its confident circulation and its irresistible force? It is the loudness of
the organ with which it is pronounced, the Stentorian lungs of the
multitude; the number of voices that take it up and repeat it, because
others have done so; the rapid flight and the impalpable nature of
common fame, that makes it a desperate undertaking for any individual
to inquire into or arrest the mischief that, in the deafening buzz or
loosened roar of laughter or of indignation, renders it impossible for
the still small voice of reason to be heard, and leaves no other course
to honesty or prudence than to fall flat on the face before it as before
the pestilential blast of the Desert, and wait till it has passed over.
Thus everyone joins in asserting, propagating, and in outwardly
approving what everyone, in his private and unbiassed judgment,
believes and knows to be scandalous and untrue. For everyone in
such circumstances keeps his own opinion to himself, and only attends
to or acts upon that which he conceives to be the opinion of everyone
but himself. So that public opinion is not seldom a farce, equal to
any acted upon the stage. Not only is it spurious and hollow in the
way that Mr. Locke points out, by one man’s taking up at second-hand
the opinion of another, but worse than this, one man takes up
what he believes another <em>will</em> think and which the latter professes
only because he believes it held by the first! All therefore that is
necessary, to control public opinion, is, to gain possession of some
organ loud and lofty enough to make yourself heard, that has power
and interest on its side; and then, no sooner do you blow a blast in
this trump of <em>ill-fame</em>, like the horn hung up by an old castle-wall,
than you are answered, echoed, and accredited on all sides: the gates
are thrown open to receive you, and you are admitted into the very heart
of the fortress of public opinion, and can assail from the ramparts
with every engine of abuse, and with privileged impunity, all those
who may come forward to vindicate the truth, or to rescue their
good name from the unprincipled keeping of authority, servility,
sophistry and venal falsehood! The only thing wanted is to give an
alarm—to excite a panic in the public mind of being left <em>in the lurch</em>,
and the rabble (whether in the ranks of literature or war) will throw
away their arms, and surrender at discretion to any bully or impostor
who, for a <em>consideration</em>, shall choose to try the experiment upon them!</p>

<p class='c007'>What I have here described is the effect even upon the candid and
well-disposed:—what must it be to the malicious and idle, who are
eager to believe all the ill they can hear of everyone; or to the
prejudiced and interested, who are determined to credit all the ill
they hear against those who are not of their own side? To these
last it is only requisite to be understood that the butt of ridicule or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>slander is of an opposite party, and they presently give you <em>carte
blanche</em> to say what you please of him. Do they know that it is true?
No; but they believe what all the world says, till they have evidence
to the contrary. Do you prove that it is false? They dare say,
that if not, that something worse remains behind; and they retain the
same opinion as before, for the honour of their party. They hire
someone to pelt you with mud, and then affect to avoid you in the
street as a dirty fellow. They are told that you have a hump on
your back, and then wonder at your assurance or want of complaisance
in walking into a room where they are, without it. Instead
of apologising for the mistake, and, from finding one aspersion false,
doubting all the rest, they are only more confirmed in the remainder
from being deprived of one handle against you, and resent their disappointment,
instead of being ashamed of their credulity. People
talk of the bigotry of the Catholics, and treat with contempt the
absurd claim of the Popes to infallibility—I think, with little right to
do so. I walk into a church in Paris, where I am struck with a
number of idle forms and ceremonies, the chaunting of the service in
Latin, the shifting of the surplices, the sprinkling of holy-water, the
painted windows ‘casting a dim religious light,’ the wax-tapers, the
pealing organ: the common people seem attentive and devout, and to
put entire faith in all this—Why? Because they imagine others to
do so, they see and hear certain signs and supposed evidences of it,
and it amuses and fills up the void of the mind, the love of the
mysterious and wonderful, to lend their assent to it. They have
assuredly, in general, no better reason—all our Protestant divines will
tell you so. Well, I step out of the church of St. Roche, and drop
into an English reading-room hard by: what am I the better? I
see a dozen or a score of my countrymen, with their faces fixed, and
their eyes glued to a newspaper, a magazine, a review—reading,
swallowing, profoundly ruminating on the lie, the cant, the sophism
of the day! Why? It saves them the trouble of thinking; it
gratifies their ill-humour, and keeps off <em>ennui</em>! Does any gleam of
doubt, an air of ridicule or a glance of impatience pass across their
features at the shallow and monstrous things they find? No, it is all
passive faith and dull security; they cannot take their eyes from the
page, they cannot live without it. They believe in Mr. Blackwood,
(you see it in their faces) as implicitly as in Sir John Barleycorn; in
the John Bull as in a sirloin of beef; in the Quarterly as assuredly
as in quarter-day—as they hope to receive their rents, or to see old
England again! Are not the Popes, the Fathers, the Councils, as
good as these oracles, scouts, and champions of theirs? They know
that the John Bull, for instance, is a hoax, a humbug, an impudent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>imposture, got up, week by week, to puff whom it pleases, to bully
whom it pleases, to traduce whom it pleases, without any principle
but a hint from its patrons, or without a pretence to any other principle.
Do they believe in the known lie, the gross ribaldry, the foul calumny,
the less on that account? They believe the more in it: because it is
got up solely and expressly to serve a cause that needs such support—and
they swear by whatever is devoted to this object.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greater the profligacy, the effrontery, the servility, the greater
the faith. Strange! that the British public (whether at home or
abroad) should shake their heads at the Lady of Loretto, and repose
deliciously on Mr. Theodore Hook! It may be thought that the
enlightened part of the British public (persons of family and fortune,
and often title, who have had a college-education and received the
benefit of foreign travel) see through the quackery, which they
encourage only for a political purpose, without being themselves the
dupes of it. Suppose an individual of whom it has been repeatedly
asserted that he has warts on his nose, were to enter the reading-room
aforesaid in the Rue de la Paix—is there a single red-faced country
squire who would not be surprised at not finding this part of the story
true—would not persuade himself five minutes after that he could not
have been seen correctly, or that some art had been used to conceal
the defect, or would be led to doubt, from this instance, Mr. Blackwood’s
general candour and veracity? On the contrary, the gentleman
would be obliged to disbelieve his senses rather than give
Mr. Blackwood the lie, who is read and believed by the whole
world. He would have a host of witnesses against him: there is not
a reader of Blackwood who would not swear to the fact. Seeing is
believing, it is said. Lying is believing, say I. We do not even see
with our own eyes, but must ‘wink and shut our apprehensions up,’
that we may be able to agree to the report of others, as a piece of
good manners and point of established etiquette.—Besides, the supposed
deformity answered his wishes: the abuse ‘fed fat the ancient
grudge he owed’ some presumptuous scribbler, for not agreeing in a
number of points with his betters: it gave him a personal advantage
over one he did not like—and who will give up what tends to
strengthen his aversion against another? To Tory prejudice, sore
as it is—to English imagination, morbid as it is, a nickname, a ludicrous
epithet, a malignant falsehood (when it has once been propagated
and taken to bosoms as a welcome consolation) becomes a precious
property, a vested right; and people would as soon give up a sinecure,
or a share in a close borough, as a plenary indulgence (published
monthly with the court privilege) to speak and think with contempt
of those who would abolish the one or throw open the other.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ON THE CAUSES OF POPULAR OPINION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The London Weekly Review.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>February 16, 1828.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>Party-Spirit is the best reason in the world for personal antipathy
and vulgar abuse.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘But, do you not think, Sir,’ (methinks I hear some Scotch
dialectician exclaim,) ‘that belief is involuntary, and that we judge
in all cases according to the precise degree of evidence and the positive
facts before us?’</p>

<p class='c007'>No, Sir.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘You believe, then, in the doctrine of philosophical free-will?’</p>

<p class='c007'>Indeed, Sir, I do not.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘How then, Sir, am I to understand so unaccountable a diversity
of opinion from the most approved writers on the philosophy of the
human mind, such as Mr. Dugald Stewart and the Editors of the
Edinburgh Encyclopædia?’</p>

<p class='c007'>May I ask, my dear Sir, did you ever read Mr. Wordsworth’s
poem of Michael?</p>

<p class='c007'>‘I cannot charge my memory with the fact; or I paid no particular
attention to it at the time, as I have always agreed with the Edinburgh
Review in considering Mr. Wordsworth’s poetry as remarkably silly
and puerile.’</p>

<p class='c007'>But still true to Nature in a humble way.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Why, I think, Sir, something of that kind is admitted (either by
way of ridicule or praise) in the article in the Review.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Well, Sir, this Michael is an old shepherd, who has a son who
goes to sea, and who turns out a great reprobate by all the accounts
received of him. Before he went, however, the father took the boy
with him into a mountain-glen, and made him lay the first stone of a
sheep-fold, which was to be a covenant and a remembrance between
them if anything ill happened. For years after, the old man used to
go to work at this sheep-fold—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Among the rocks</div>
      <div class='line'>He went, and still look’d up upon the sun,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And listen’d to the wind’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>and sat by the half-finished work, expecting the lad’s return, or
hoping to hear some better tidings of him. Was this hope founded
on reason—or was it not owing to the strength of affection which, in
spite of everything, could not relinquish its hold of a favourite object,
indeed the only one that bound it to existence?</p>

<p class='c007'>Not being able to make my Scotchman answer kindly to interrogatories,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>I must get on without him. Indeed, I have generally found the
natives of that country greater hindrances than helps. In matters of
absolute demonstration and speculative indifferences, I grant, that belief
is involuntary, and the proof not to be resisted; but then, in such
matters, there is no difference of opinion, or the difference is
adjusted amicably and rationally. Hobbes is of opinion, that if their
passions or interests could be implicated in the question, men would
deny stoutly that the three angles of a right-angled triangle are equal
to two right ones: and the disputes in religion look something like it.
I only contend, however, that in all cases not of this peremptory and
determinate cast, and where disputes commonly arise, inclination,
habit, and example have a powerful share in throwing in the casting-weight
to our opinions; and that he who is only tolerably free from
these, and not their regular dupe or slave, is indeed ‘a man of ten
thousand.’ Take, for instance, the example of a Catholic clergyman
in a Popish country: it will generally be found that he lives and dies
in the faith in which he was brought up, as the Protestant clergyman
does in his.—Shall we say that the necessity of gaining a livelihood,
or the prospect of preferment, that the early bias given to his mind
by education and study, the pride of victory, the shame of defeat, the
example and encouragement of all about him, the respect and love of
his flock, the flattering notice of the great, have no effect in giving
consistency to his opinions and carrying them through to the last?
Yet, who will suppose that in either case this apparent uniformity is
mere hypocrisy, or that the intellects of the two classes of divines are
naturally adapted to the arguments in favour of the two religions they
have occasion to profess? No: but the understanding takes a
tincture from outward impulses and circumstances, and is led to dwell
on those suggestions which favour, and to blind itself to the objections
which impugn, the side to which it previously and morally inclines.
Again, even in those who oppose established opinions, and form the
little, firm, formidable phalanx of dissent, have not early instruction,
spiritual pride, the love of contradiction, a resistance to usurped
authority, as much to do with the keeping up the war of sects and
schisms as the abstract love of truth or conviction of the understanding?
Does not persecution fan the flame in such fiery tempers, and
does it not expire, or grow lukewarm, with indulgence and neglect?
I have a sneaking kindness for a Popish priest in this country; and
to a Catholic peer I would willingly bow in passing. What are
national antipathies, individual attachments, but so many expressions
of the <em>moral</em> principle in forming our opinions? All our opinions
become grounds on which we act, and build our expectations of good
or ill; and this good or ill mixed up with them is soon changed into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>the ruling principle which modifies or violently supersedes the original
cool determination of the reason and senses. The will, when it once
gets a footing, turns the sober judgment out of doors. If we form
an attachment to anyone, are we not slow in giving it up? or, if our
suspicions are once excited, are we not equally rash and violent in
believing the worst? Othello characterizes himself as one</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Who loved not wisely, but too well;</div>
      <div class='line'>As one not easily wrought—but, being jealous,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Perplex’d in the extreme.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And this answers to the movements and irregularities of passion and
opinion which take place in human nature. If we wish a thing, we
are disposed to believe it; if we have been accustomed to believe it,
we are the more obstinate in defending it on that account: if all the
world differ from us in any questions of moment, we are ashamed to
own it; or are hurried by peevishness and irritation into extravagance
and paradox. The weight of example presses upon us (whether we
feel it or not) like the law of gravitation. He who sustains his
opinion by the strength of conviction and evidence alone, unmoved by
ridicule, neglect, obloquy, or privation, shows no less resolution than
the Hindoo who makes and keeps a vow to hold his right arm in the
air till it grows rigid and callous.</p>

<p class='c007'>To have all the world against us is trying to a man’s temper and
philosophy. It unhinges even our opinion of our own motives and
intentions. It is like striking the actual world from under our
feet: the void that is left, the death-like pause, the chilling
suspense, is fearful. The growth of an opinion is like the growth of
a limb: it receives its actual support and nourishment from the
general body of the opinions, feelings, and practice of the world:
without that, it soon withers, festers, and becomes useless. To what
purpose write a good book, if it is sure to be pronounced a bad one,
even before it is read? If our thoughts are to be blown stifling back
upon ourselves, why utter them at all? It is only exposing what we
love most to contumely and insult, and thus depriving ourselves of our
own relish and satisfaction in them. Language is only made to communicate
our sentiments, and if we can find no one to receive them,
we are reduced to the silence of dumbness, we live but in the solitude
of a dungeon. If we do not vindicate our opinions, we seem poor
creatures who have no right to them; if we speak out, we are involved
in continual brawls and controversy. If we contemn what others
admire, we make ourselves odious: if we admire what they despise,
we are equally ridiculous. We have not the applause of the world
nor the support of a party: we can neither enjoy the freedom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>social intercourse, nor the calm of privacy. With our respect for
others, we lose confidence in ourselves: everything seems to be a
subject of litigation—to want proof or confirmation; we doubt, by
degrees, whether we stand on our head or our heels—whether we
know our right hand from our left. If I am assured that I never
wrote a sentence of common English in my life, how can I know that
that is not the case? If I am told at one time that my writings are
as heavy as lead, and at another, that they are more light than the
gossamer—what resource have I but to choose between the two? I
could say, if this were the place, what those writings are.—‘Make it
the place, and never stand upon punctilio!’</p>

<p class='c007'>They are not, then, so properly the works of an author by
profession, as the thoughts of a metaphysician expressed by a painter.
They are subtle and difficult problems translated into hieroglyphics.
I thought for several years on the hardest subjects, on Fate, Free-Will,
Foreknowledge absolute, without ever making use of words or
images at all, and that has made them come in such throngs and
confused heaps when I burst from that void of abstraction. In
proportion to the tenuity to which my ideas had been drawn, and my
abstinence from ornament and sensible objects, was the tenaciousness
with which actual circumstances and picturesque imagery laid hold of
my mind, when I turned my attention to them, or had to look round
for illustrations. Till I began to paint, or till I became acquainted
with the author of <cite>The Ancient Mariner</cite>, I could neither write nor
speak. He encouraged me to write a book, which I did according
to the original bent of my mind, making it as dry and meagre as I
could, so that it fell still-born from the press, and none of those
who abuse me for a shallow <em>catch-penny</em> writer have so much as heard
of it. Yet, let me say that that work contains an important metaphysical
discovery, supported by a continuous and severe train of
reasoning, nearly as subtle and original as anything in Hume or
Berkeley. I am not accustomed to speak of myself in this manner,
but impudence may provoke modesty to justify itself. Finding this
method did not answer, I despaired for a time: but some trifle I
wrote in the Morning Chronicle meeting the approbation of the
Editor and the town, I resolved to turn over a new leaf—to take the
public at its word, to muster all the tropes and figures I could lay
hands on, and, though I am a plain man, never to appear abroad but
in an embroidered dress. Still, old habits will prevail; and I hardly
ever set about a paragraph or a criticism, but there was an undercurrent
of thought, or some generic distinction on which the whole
turned. Having got my clue, I had no difficulty in stringing pearls
upon it; and the more recondite the point, the more I laboured to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>bring it out and set it off by a variety of ornaments and allusions.
This puzzled the court-scribes, whose business it was to crush me.
They could not see the meaning: they would not see the colouring,
for it hurt their eyes. Oh, had I been but one of them, I might
even have dined with Mr. Murray! One cried out, it was dull;
another, that it was too fine by half: my friends took up this last
alternative as the most favourable; and since then it has been agreed
that I am a florid writer, somewhat flighty and paradoxical. Yet,
when I wished to unburthen my mind in the Edinburgh by an article
on English (not Scotch) metaphysics, J—— who echoes this <em>florid</em>
charge, said he preferred what I wrote for effect, and was afraid of
its being thought heavy—by the side of Macculloch! I have
accounted for the flowers;—the paradoxes may be accounted for in
the same way. All abstract reasoning is in extremes, or only takes
up one view of a question, or what is called the principle of the thing;
and if you want to give this popularity and effect, you are in danger
of running into extravagance and hyperbole. I have had to bring out
some obscure distinction, or to combat some strong prejudice, and in
doing this with all my might, may have often overshot the mark.
It was easy to correct the excess of truth afterwards. I have been
accused of inconsistency, for writing an essay, for instance, on the
Advantages of Pedantry, and another, on the <em>Ignorance of the Learned</em>,
as if ignorance had not its comforts as well as knowledge. The
personalities I have fallen into have never been gratuitous. If I have
sacrificed my friends, it has always been to a theory. I have been
found fault with for repeating myself, and for a narrow range of ideas.
To a want of general reading, I plead guilty, and am sorry for it;
but perhaps if I had read more, I might have thought less. As to
my barrenness of invention, I have at least glanced over a number of
subjects—painting, poetry, prose, plays, politics, parliamentary speakers,
metaphysical lore, books, men, and things. There is some point,
some fancy, some feeling, some taste shown in treating of these.
Which of my conclusions has been reversed? Is it what I said ten
years ago of the Bourbons which raised the warwhoop against me?
Surely all the world are of that opinion now. I have, then, given
proofs of some talent, and of more honesty: if there is haste or want
of method, there is no common-place, nor a line that licks the dust;
and if I do not appear to more advantage, I at least appear such as I
am. If the Editor of the Atlas will do me the favour to look over
my <cite>Essay on the Principles of Human Action</cite>, will dip into any essay I
ever wrote (except one that appeared in the Retrospective Review,
which was not my own, though I was very handsomely paid the full
price of an original composition for it), and will take a sponge and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>clear the dust from the face of my <em>Old Woman</em> (which he can see at
a common friend’s), I hope he will, upon second thoughts, acquit me
of an absolute dearth of resources and want of versatility in the
direction of my studies.</p>

<p class='c013'>Expected, well enough:—gone, still better. Such attractions are
strengthened by distance. Nor a mistress? ‘Beautiful mask! I
know thee!’ When I can judge of the heart from the face, of the
thoughts from the lips, I may again trust myself. Instead of these,
give me the robin red-breast, pecking the crumbs at the door, or
warbling on the leafless spray, the same glancing form that has
followed me wherever I have been, and ‘done its spiriting gently;’
or the rich notes of the thrush that startle the ear of winter, and
seem to have drunk up the full draught of joy from the very
sense of contrast. To these I adhere and am faithful, for they are
true to me; and, dear in themselves, are dearer for the sake of what
is departed, leading me back (by the hand) to that dreaming world,
in the innocence of which they sat and made sweet music, waking
the promise of future years, and answered by the eager throbbings of
my own breast. But now ‘the credulous hope of mutual minds is
o’er,’ and I turn back from the world that has deceived me, to nature
that lent it a false beauty, and that keeps up the illusion of the past.
As I quaff my libations of tea in a morning, I love to watch the
clouds sailing from the west, and fancy that ‘the spring comes slowly
up this way.’ In this hope, while ‘fields are dank and ways are
mire,’ I follow the same direction to a neighbouring wood, where,
having gained the dry, level greensward, I can see my way for a mile
before me, closed in on each side by copse-wood, and ending in a
point of light more or less brilliant, as the day is bright or cloudy.
What a walk is this to me! I have no need of book or companion—the
days, the hours, the thoughts of my youth are at my side, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>blend with the air that fans my cheek. Here I can saunter for
hours, bending my eye forward, stopping and turning to look back,
thinking to strike off into some less trodden path, yet hesitating to
quit the one I am in, afraid to snap the brittle threads of memory. I
remark the shining trunks and slender branches of the birch trees,
waving in the idle breeze; or a pheasant springs up on whirring wing;
or I recall the spot where I once found a wood-pigeon at the foot
of a tree, weltering in its gore, and think how many seasons have
flown since ‘it left its little life in air.’ Dates, names, faces come
back—to what purpose? Or why think of them now? Or rather,
why not think of them oftener? We walk through life, as through
a narrow path, with a thin curtain drawn around it; behind are
ranged rich portraits, airy harps are strung—yet we will not stretch
forth our hands and lift aside the veil, to catch glimpses of the one,
or sweep the chords of the other. As in a theatre, when the old-fashioned
green curtain drew up, groups of figures, fantastic dresses,
laughing faces, rich banquets, stately columns, gleaming vistas appeared
beyond; so we have only at any time to ‘peep through the blanket
of the past,’ to possess ourselves at once of all that has regaled our
senses, that is stored up in our memory, that has struck our fancy,
that has pierced our hearts:—yet to all this we are indifferent, insensible,
and seem intent only on the present vexation, the future
disappointment. If there is a Titian hanging up in the room with
me, I scarcely regard it: how then should I be expected to strain
the mental eye so far, or to throw down, by the magic spells of the
will, the stone-walls that enclose it in the Louvre? There is one
head there of which I have often thought, when looking at it, that
nothing should ever disturb me again, and I would become the
character it represents—such perfect calmness and self-possession
reigns in it! Why do I not hang an image of this in some dusky
corner of my brain, and turn an eye upon it ever and anon, as I have
need of some such talisman to calm my troubled thoughts? The
attempt is fruitless, if not natural; or, like that of the French, to
hang garlands on the grave, and to conjure back the dead by
miniature pictures of them while living! It is only some actual
coincidence, or local association that tends, without violence, to ‘open
all the cells where memory slept.’ I can easily, by stooping over the
long-sprent grass and clay-cold clod, recall the tufts of primroses, or
purple hyacinths, that formerly grew on the same spot, and cover the
bushes with leaves and singing-birds, as they were eighteen summers
ago; or prolonging my walk and hearing the sighing gale rustle
through a tall, strait wood at the end of it, can fancy that I distinguish
the cry of hounds, and the fatal group issuing from it, as in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>the tale of Theodore and Honoria. A moaning gust of wind aids
the belief; I look once more to see whether the trees before me
answer to the idea of the horror-stricken grove, and an air-built city
towers over their grey tops.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>I return home resolved to read the entire poem through, and, after
dinner, drawing my chair to the fire, and holding a small print close
to my eyes, launch into the full tide of Dryden’s couplets (a stream
of sound), comparing his didactic and descriptive pomp with the
simple pathos and picturesque truth of Boccacio’s story, and tasting
with a pleasure, which none but an habitual reader can feel, some
quaint examples of pronunciation in this accomplished versifier.</p>

    </div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>These trifling instances of the wavering and unsettled state of the
language give double effect to the firm and stately march of the verse,
and make me dwell with a sort of tender interest on the difficulties
and doubts of an earlier period of literature. They pronounced words
then in a manner which we should laugh at now; and they wrote
verse in a manner which we can do anything but laugh at. The
pride of a new acquisition seems to give fresh confidence to it; to
impel the rolling syllables through the moulds provided for them, and
to overflow the envious bounds of rhyme into time-honoured triplets.
I am much pleased with Leigh Hunt’s mention of Moore’s involuntary

<p class='c007'>What sometimes surprises me in looking back to the past, is, with
the exception already stated, to find myself so little changed in the
time. The same images and trains of thought stick by me: I have
the same tastes, likings, sentiments, and wishes that I had then. One
great ground of confidence and support has, indeed, been struck from
under my feet; but I have made it up to myself by proportionable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>pertinacity of opinion. The success of the great cause, to which I
had vowed myself, was to me more than all the world: I had a
strength in its strength, a resource which I knew not of, till it failed
me for the second time.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>It was not till I saw the axe laid to the root, that I found the full
extent of what I had to lose and suffer. But my conviction of the
right was only established by the triumph of the wrong; and my
earliest hopes will be my last regrets. One source of this unbendingness,
(which some may call obstinacy,) is that, though living much
alone, I have never worshipped the Echo. I see plainly enough that
black is not white, that the grass is green, that kings are not their
subjects; and, in such self-evident cases, do not think it necessary to
collate my opinions with the received prejudices. In subtler questions,
and matters that admit of doubt, as I do not impose my opinion on
others without a reason, so I will not give up mine to them without a
better reason; and a person calling me names, or giving himself airs
of authority, does not convince me of his having taken more pains to
find out the truth than I have, but the contrary. Mr. Gifford once
said, that ‘while I was sitting over my gin and tobacco-pipes, I
fancied myself a Leibnitz.’ He did not so much as know that I had
ever read a metaphysical book:—was I therefore, out of complaisance
or deference to him, to forget whether I had or not? I am rather
disappointed, both on my own account and his, that Mr. Hunt has
missed the opportunity of explaining the character of a friend, as
clearly as he might have done. He is puzzled to reconcile the
shyness of my pretensions with the inveteracy and sturdiness of my
principles. I should have thought they were nearly the same thing.
Both from disposition and habit, I can <em>assume</em> nothing in word, look,
or manner. I cannot steal a march upon public opinion in any
way. My standing upright, speaking loud, entering a room gracefully,
proves nothing; therefore I neglect these ordinary means of
recommending myself to the good graces and admiration of strangers,
(and, as it appears, even of philosophers and friends). Why?
Because I have other resources, or, at least, am absorbed in other
studies and pursuits. Suppose this absorption to be extreme, and even
morbid, that I have brooded over an idea till it has become a kind
of substance in my brain, that I have reasons for a thing which I
have found out with much labour and pains, and to which I can
scarcely do justice without the utmost violence of exertion (and that
only to a few persons,)—is this a reason for my playing off my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>out-of-the-way notions in all companies, wearing a prim and self-complacent
air, as if I were ‘the admired of all observers?’ or is it
not rather an argument, (together with a want of animal spirits,) why
I should retire into myself, and perhaps acquire a nervous and uneasy
look, from a consciousness of the disproportion between the interest and
conviction I feel on certain subjects, and my ability to communicate
what weighs upon my own mind to others? If my ideas, which I do
not avouch, but suppose, lie below the surface, why am I to be always
attempting to dazzle superficial people with them, or smiling, delighted,
at my own want of success?</p>

<p class='c007'>What I have here stated is only the excess of the common and
well-known English and scholastic character. I am neither a buffoon,
a fop, nor a Frenchman, which Mr. Hunt would have me to be.
He finds it odd that I am a close reasoner and a loose dresser. I
have been (among other follies) a hard liver as well as a hard
thinker; and the consequences of that will not allow me to dress
as I please. People in real life are not like players on a stage, who
put on a certain look or <em>costume</em>, merely for effect. I am aware,
indeed, that the gay and airy pen of the author does not seriously
probe the errors or misfortunes of his friends—he only glances at
their seeming peculiarities, so as to make them odd and ridiculous;
for which forbearance few of them will thank him. Why does he
assert that I was vain of my hair when it was black, and am equally
vain of it now it is grey, when this is true in neither case? This
transposition of motives makes me almost doubt whether Lord Byron
was thinking so much of the rings on his fingers as his biographer
was. These sort of criticisms should be left to women. I am made
to wear a little hat, stuck on the top of my head the wrong way.
Nay, I commonly wear a large slouching hat over my eyebrows;
and if ever I had another, I must have twisted it about in any shape
to get rid of the annoyance. This probably tickled Mr. Hunt’s
fancy, and retains possession of it, to the exclusion of the obvious
truism, that I naturally wear ‘a melancholy hat.’</p>

<p class='c007'>I am charged with using strange gestures and contortions of
features in argument, in order to ‘look energetic.’ One would
rather suppose that the heat of the argument produced the extravagance
of the gestures, as I am said to be calm at other times.
It is like saying that a man in a passion clenches his teeth, not
because he is, but in order to seem, angry. Why should everything
be construed into air and affectation? With Hamlet, I may say,
‘I know not <em>seems</em>.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, my old friend and pleasant ‘Companion’ remarks it, as an
anomaly in my character, that I crawl about the Fives Court like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>cripple till I get the racket in my hand, when I start up as if I was
possessed with a devil. I have then a motive for exertion; I lie by
for difficulties and extreme cases. <em>Aut Cæsar aut nullus.</em> I have no
notion of doing nothing with an air of importance, nor should I ever
take a liking to the game of battledoor and shuttlecock. I have
only seen by accident a page of the unpublished Manuscript relating
to the present subject, which I dare say is, on the whole, friendly
and just, and which has been suppressed as being too favourable,
considering certain prejudices against me.</p>

<p class='c007'>In matters of taste and feeling, one proof that my conclusions have
not been quite shallow or hasty, is the circumstance of their having
been lasting. I have the same favourite books, pictures, passages
that I ever had: I may therefore presume that they will last me my
life—nay, I may indulge a hope that my thoughts will survive me.
This continuity of impression is the only thing on which I pride
myself. Even L——, whose relish of certain things is as keen and
earnest as possible, takes a surfeit of admiration, and I should be
afraid to ask about his select authors or particular friends, after a
lapse of ten years. As to myself, any one knows where to have me.
What I have once made up my mind to, I abide by to the end of
the chapter. One cause of my independence of opinion is, I believe,
the liberty I give to others, or the very diffidence and distrust of
making converts. I should be an excellent man on a jury: I might
say little, but should starve ‘the other eleven obstinate fellows’ out.
I remember Mr. Godwin writing to Mr. Wordsworth, that ‘his
tragedy of Antonio could not fail of success.’ It was damned past
all redemption. I said to Mr. Wordsworth that I thought this a
natural consequence; for how could any one have a dramatic turn of
mind who judged entirely of others from himself? Mr. Godwin
might be convinced of the excellence of his work; but how could
he know that others would be convinced of it, unless by supposing
that they were as wise as himself, and as infallible critics of dramatic
poetry—so many Aristotles sitting in judgment on Euripides! This
shows why pride is connected with shyness and reserve; for the
really proud have not so high an opinion of the generality as to
suppose that they can understand them, or that there is any common
measure between them. So Dryden exclaims of his opponents with
bitter disdain—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Nor can I think what thoughts they can conceive.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I have not sought to make partisans, still less did I dream of making
enemies; and have therefore kept my opinions myself, whether they
were currently adopted or not. To get others to come into our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>ways of thinking, we must go over to theirs; and it is necessary to
follow, in order to lead. At the time I lived here formerly, I had
no suspicion that I should ever become a voluminous writer; yet
I had just the same confidence in my feelings before I had ventured
to air them in public as I have now. Neither the outcry <em>for</em> or
<em>against</em> moves me a jot: I do not say that the one is not more
agreeable than the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not far from the spot where I write, I first read Chaucer’s
<em>Flower and Leaf</em>, and was charmed with that young beauty, shrouded
in her bower, and listening with ever-fresh delight to the repeated
song of the nightingale close by her—the impression of the scene,
the vernal landscape, the cool of the morning, the gushing notes of
the songstress,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And ayen, methought she sung close by mine ear,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>is as vivid as if it had been of yesterday; and nothing can persuade
me that that is not a fine poem. I do not find this impression
conveyed in Dryden’s version, and therefore nothing can persuade
me that that is as fine. I used to walk out at this time with Mr.
and Miss L—— of an evening, to look at the Claude Lorraine
skies over our heads, melting from azure into purple and gold, and
to gather mushrooms, that sprung up at our feet, to throw into our
hashed mutton at supper. I was at that time an enthusiastic admirer
of Claude, and could dwell for ever on one or two of the finest
prints from him hung round my little room; the fleecy flocks, the
bending trees, the winding streams, the groves, the nodding temples,
the air-wove hills, and distant sunny vales; and tried to translate
them into their lovely living hues. People then told me that
Wilson was much superior to Claude. I did not believe them.
Their pictures have since been seen together at the British Institution,
and all the world have come into my opinion. I have not, on
that account, given it up. I will not compare our hashed mutton
with Amelia’s; but it put us in mind of it, and led to a discussion,
sharply seasoned and well sustained, till midnight, the result of which
appeared some years after in the Edinburgh Review. Have I a
better opinion of those criticisms on that account, or should I therefore
maintain them with greater vehemence and tenaciousness? Oh
no! Both rather with less, now that they are before the public,
and it is for them to make their election.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is in looking back to such scenes that I draw my best consolation
for the future. Later impressions come and go, and serve to
fill up the intervals; but these are my standing resource, my true
classics. If I have had few real pleasures or advantages, my ideas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>from their sinewy texture, have been to me in the nature of realities;
and if I should not be able to add to the stock, I can live by
husbanding the interest. As to my speculations, there is little to
admire in them but my admiration of others; and whether they
have an echo in time to come or not, I have learned to set a grateful
value on the past, and am content to wind up the account of what is
personal only to myself and the immediate circle of objects in which
I have moved, with an act of easy oblivion,</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>BYRON AND WORDSWORTH</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The London Weekly Review.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>April 5, 1828.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>I am much surprised at Lord Byron’s haste to return a volume of
Spenser, which was lent him by Mr. Hunt, and at his apparent
indifference to the progress and (if he pleased) <em>advancement</em> of poetry
up to the present day. Did he really think that all genius was
concentred in his own time, or in his own bosom? With his pride
of ancestry, had he no curiosity to explore the heraldry of intellect?
or did he regard the Muse as an upstart—a mere modern <em>bluestocking</em>
and fine lady? I am afraid that high birth and station, instead of
being (as Mr. Burke predicates,) ‘a cure for a narrow and selfish
mind,’ only make a man more full of himself, and, instead of enlarging
and refining his views, impatient of any but the most inordinate
and immediate stimulus. I do not recollect, in all Lord Byron’s
writings, a single recurrence to a feeling or object that had ever
excited an interest before; there is no display of natural affection—no
twining of the heart round any object: all is the restless and
disjointed effect of first impressions, of novelty, contrast, surprise,
grotesque costume, or sullen grandeur. <em>His</em> beauties are the <em>houris</em>
of Paradise, the favourites of a seraglio, the changing visions of a
feverish dream. His poetry, it is true, is stately and dazzling,
arched like a rainbow, of bright and lovely hues, painted on the
cloud of his own gloomy temper—perhaps to disappear as soon!
It is easy to account for the antipathy between him and Mr.
Wordsworth. Mr. Wordsworth’s poetical mistress is a Pamela;
Lord Byron’s an Eastern princess or a Moorish maid. It is the
extrinsic, the uncommon that captivates him, and all the rest he
holds in sovereign contempt. This is the obvious result of
pampered luxury and high-born sentiments. The mind, like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>palace in which it has been brought up, admits none but new and
costly furniture. From a scorn of homely simplicity, and a surfeit
of the artificial, it has but one resource left in exotic manners and
preternatural effect. So we see in novels, written by ladies of
quality, all the marvellous allurements of a fairy tale, jewels,
quarries of diamonds, giants, magicians, condors and ogres.<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c008'><sup>[55]</sup></a> The
author of the Lyrical Ballads describes the lichen on the rock, the
withered fern, with some peculiar feeling that he has about them:
the author of Childe Harold describes the stately cypress, or the
fallen column, with the feeling that every schoolboy has about
them. The world is a grown schoolboy, and relishes the latter
most. When Rousseau called out—‘<em>Ah! voila de la pervenche!</em>’
in a transport of joy at sight of the periwinkle, because he had first
seen this little blue flower in company with Madame Warens thirty
years before, I cannot help thinking, that any astonishment expressed
at the sight of a palm-tree, or even of Pompey’s Pillar, is vulgar
compared to this! Lord Byron, when he does not saunter down
Bond-street, goes into the East: when he is not occupied with
the passing topic, he goes back two thousand years, at one poetic,
gigantic stride! But instead of the sweeping mutations of empire,
and the vast lapses of duration, shrunk up into an antithesis,
commend me to the ‘slow and creeping foot of time,’ in the
commencement of Ivanhoe, where the jester and the swine-herd
watch the sun going down behind the low-stunted trees of the
forest, and their loitering and impatience make the summer’s day
seem so long, that we wonder how we have ever got to the end
of the six hundred years that have passed since! That where
the face of nature has changed, time should have rolled on its
course, is but a common-place discovery; but that where all seems
the same, (the long rank grass, and the stunted oaks, and the
innocent pastoral landscape,) all should have changed—this is to
me the burthen and the mystery. The ruined pile is a memento
and a monument to him that reared it—oblivion has here done
but half its work; but what yearnings, what vain conflicts with its
fate come over the soul in the other case, which makes man seem
like a grasshopper—an insect of the hour, and all that he is, or that
others have been—nothing!</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>A Fragment</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='left'><cite>The London Weekly Review.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>December 6, 1828.</em></span></p>

<p class='c014'>‘If to do were as easy as to teach others what were good to be done, chapels had
been churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces.’</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Addison, it is said, was fond of tippling; and Curl, it is added,
when he called on him in the morning, used to ask as a particular
favour for a glass of Canary, by way of ingratiating himself, and that
the other might have a pretence to join him and finish the bottle.
He fell a martyr to this habit, and yet (some persons more nice than
wise exclaim,) he desired that the young Earl of Warwick might
attend him on his death-bed, ‘to see how a Christian could die!’ I
see no inconsistency nor hypocrisy in this. A man may be a good
Christian, a sound believer, and a sincere lover of virtue, and have,
notwithstanding, one or more failings. If he had recommended it to
others to get drunk, then I should have said he was a hypocrite, and
that his pretended veneration for the Christian religion was a mere
cloak put on to suit the purposes of fashion or convenience. His
doing what it condemned was no proof of any such thing: ‘The
spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak.’ He is a hypocrite who
professes what he does not believe; not he who does not practice all
he wishes or approves. It might on the same ground be argued, that
a man is a hypocrite who admires Raphael or Shakespeare, because
he cannot paint like the one, or write like the other. If any one
really despised what he affected outwardly to admire, this would be
hypocrisy. If he affected to admire it a great deal more than he
really did, this would be cant. Sincerity has to do with the connexion
between our words and thoughts, and not between our belief
and actions. The last constantly belie the strongest convictions and
resolutions in the best of men; it is only the base and dishonest who
give themselves credit with their tongue, for sentiments and opinions
which in their hearts they disown.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not therefore think that the old theological maxim—‘The
greater the sinner, the greater the saint’—is so utterly unfounded.
There is some mixture of truth in it. For as long as man is composed
of two parts, body and soul; and while these are allowed to
pull different ways, I see no reason why, in proportion to the length
the one goes, the opposition or reaction of the other should not
be more violent. It is certain, for example, that no one makes
such good resolutions as the sot and the gambler in their moments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>of repentance, or can be more impressed with the horrors of their
situation;—should this disposition, instead of a transient, idle pang,
by chance become lasting, who can be supposed to feel the beauty
of temperance and economy more, or to look back with greater
gratitude to their escape from the trammels of vice and passion?
Would the ingenious and elegant author of the <span class='sc'>Spectator</span> feel less
regard for the Scriptures, because they denounced in pointed terms
the infirmity that ‘most easily beset him,’ that was the torment of his
life, and the cause of his death? Such reasoning would be true, if
man was a simple animal or a logical machine, and all his faculties
and impulses were in strict unison; instead of which they are eternally
at variance, and no one hates or takes part against himself more
heartily or heroically than does the same individual. Does he not
pass sentence on his own conduct? Is not his conscience both
judge and accuser? What else is the meaning of all our resolutions
against ourselves, as well as of our exhortations to others? <i><span lang="la">Video
meliora proboque, deteriora sequor</span></i>, is not the language of hypocrisy,
but of human nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hypocrisy of priests has been a butt for ridicule in all ages;
but I am not sure that there has not been more wit than philosophy in
it. A priest, it is true, is obliged to affect a greater degree of sanctity
than ordinary men, and probably more than he possesses; and this is
so far, I am willing to allow, hypocrisy and solemn grimace. But
I cannot admit, that though he may exaggerate, or even make an
ostentatious display of religion and virtue through habit and spiritual
pride, that this is a proof he has not these sentiments in his heart, or
that his whole behaviour is the mere acting of a part. His character,
his motives, are not altogether pure and sincere: are they therefore
all false and hollow? No such thing. It is contrary to all our
observation and experience so to interpret it. We all wear some
disguise—make some professions—use some artifice to set ourselves
off as being better than we are; and yet it is not denied that we have
some good intentions and praiseworthy qualities at bottom, though we
may endeavour to keep some others that we think less to our credit
as much as possible in the back-ground:—why then should we not
extend the same favourable construction to monks and friars, who
may be sometimes caught tripping as well as other men—with less
excuse, no doubt; but if it is also with greater remorse of conscience,
which probably often happens, their pretensions are not all downright,
barefaced imposture. Their sincerity, compared with that of other
men, can only be judged of by the proportion between the degree of
virtue they profess, and that which they practice, or at least carefully
seek to realise. To conceive it otherwise, is to insist that characters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>must be all perfect, or all vicious—neither of which suppositions is
even possible. If a clergyman is notoriously a drunkard, a debauchee,
a glutton, or a scoffer, then for him to lay claim at the same time to
extraordinary inspirations of faith or grace, is both scandalous and
ridiculous. The scene between the Abbot and the poor brother in
the ‘Duenna’ is an admirable exposure of this double-faced dealing.
But because a parson has a relish for the good things of this life, or
what is commonly called a <em>liquorish tooth in his head</em>, (beyond what he
would have it supposed by others, or even by himself,) that he has
therefore no fear or belief of the next, I hold for a crude and vulgar
prejudice. If a poor half-starved parish priest pays his court to an
<em>olla podrida</em>, or a venison pasty, with uncommon <em>gusto</em>, shall we say
that he has no other sentiments in offering his devotions to a crucifix,
or in counting his beads? I see no more ground for such an inference,
than for affirming that Handel was not in earnest when he sat down
to compose a Symphony, because he had at the same time perhaps a
bottle of cordials in his cupboard; or that Raphael was not entitled
to the epithet of <em>divine</em>, because he was attached to the Fornarina!
Everything has its turn in this chequered scene of things, unless we
prevent it from taking its turn by over-rigid conditions, or drive men
to despair or the most callous effrontery, by erecting a standard of
perfection, to which no one can conform in reality! Thomson, in his
‘Castle of Indolence,’ (a subject on which his pen ran riot,) has
indulged in rather a free description of ‘a little round, fat, oily man
of God—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Who shone all glittering with ungodly dew,</div>
      <div class='line'>If a tight damsel chanced to trippen by;</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, when observed, he shrunk into his mew,</div>
      <div class='line'>And straight would recollect his piety anew.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Now, was the piety in this case the less real, because it had been
forgotten for a moment? Or even if this motive should not prove
the strongest in the end, would this therefore show that it was none,
which is necessary to the argument here combated, or to make out
our little plump priest a very knave! A priest may be honest, and
yet err; as a woman may be modest, and yet half-inclined to
be a rake. So the virtue of prudes may be suspected, though
not their sincerity. The strength of their passions may make
them more conscious of their weakness, and more cautious of
exposing themselves; but not more to blind others than as a
guard upon themselves. Again, suppose a clergyman hazards a
jest upon sacred subjects, does it follow that he does not believe
a word of the matter? Put the case that any one else, encouraged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>by his example, takes up the banter or levity, and see what
effect it will have upon the reverend divine. He will turn
round like a serpent trod upon, with all the vehemence and asperity
of the most bigoted orthodoxy. Is this dictatorial and exclusive
spirit then put on merely as a mask and to browbeat others? No;
but he thinks he is privileged to trifle with the subject safely himself,
from the store of evidence he has in reserve, and from the nature of
his functions; but he is afraid of serious consequences being drawn
from what others might say, or from his seeming to countenance it;
and the moment the Church is in danger, or his own faith brought in
question, his attachment to each becomes as visible as his hatred to
those who dare to impugn either the one or the other. A woman’s
attachment to her husband is not to be suspected, if she will allow no
one to abuse him but herself! It has been remarked, that with the
spread of liberal opinions, or a more general scepticism on articles of
faith, the clergy and religious persons in general have become more
squeamish and jealous of any objections to their favourite doctrines:
but this is what must follow in the natural course of things—the
resistance being always in proportion to the danger; and arguments
and books that were formerly allowed to pass unheeded, because it
was supposed impossible they could do any mischief, are now denounced
or prohibited with the most zealous vigilance, from a knowledge
of the contagious nature of their influence and contents. So in
morals, it is obvious that the greatest nicety of expression and allusion
must be observed, where the manners are the most corrupt, and the
imagination most easily excited, not out of mere affectation, but as a
dictate of common sense and decency.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the finest remarks that has been made in modern times, is
that of Lord Shaftesbury, that there is no such thing as a perfect
Theist, or an absolute Atheist; that whatever may be the general
conviction entertained on the subject, the evidence is not and cannot
be at all times equally present to the mind; that even if it were, we
are not in the same humour to receive it: a fit of the gout, a shower
of rain shakes our best-established conclusions; and according to circumstances
and the frame of mind we are in, our belief varies from
the most sanguine enthusiasm to lukewarm indifference, or the most
gloomy despair. There is a point of conceivable faith which might
prevent any lapse from virtue, and reconcile all contrarieties between
theory and practice; but this is not to be looked for in the ordinary
course of nature, and is reserved for the abodes of the blest. Here,
‘upon this bank and shoal of time,’ the utmost we can hope to attain
is, a strong habitual belief in the excellence of virtue, or the dispensations
of Providence; and the conflict of the passions, and their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>occasional mastery over us, far from disproving or destroying this
general, rational conviction, often fling us back more forcibly upon it,
and like other infidelities and misunderstandings, produce all the
alternate remorse and raptures of repentance and reconciliation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been frequently remarked that the most obstinate heretic or
confirmed sceptic, witnessing the service of the Roman Catholic
church, the elevation of the host amidst the sounds of music, the
pomp of ceremonies, the embellishments of art, feels himself spell-bound:
and is almost persuaded to become a renegade to his reason
or his religion. Even in hearing a vespers chaunted on the stage, or
in reading an account of a torch-light procession in a romance, a
superstitious awe creeps over the frame, and we are momentarily
charmed out of ourselves. When such is the obvious and involuntary
influence of circumstances on the imagination, shall we say that a
monkish recluse surrounded from his childhood by all this pomp,
a stranger to any other faith, who has breathed no other atmosphere,
and all whose meditations are bent on this one subject both by interest
and habit and duty, is to be set down as a rank and heartless mountebank
in the professions he makes of belief in it, because his thoughts
may sometimes wander to forbidden subjects, or his feet stumble on
forbidden ground? Or shall not the deep shadows of the woods
in Vallombrosa enhance the solemnity of this feeling, or the icy
horrors of the Grand Chartreux add to its elevation and its purity?
To argue otherwise is to misdeem of human nature, and to limit its
capacities for good or evil by some narrow-minded standard of
our own. Man is neither a God nor a brute; but there is a
prosaic and a poetical side to everything concerning him, and it is
as impossible absolutely and for a constancy to exclude either one
or the other from the mind, as to make him live without air or food.
The <em>ideal</em>, the empire of thought and aspiration after truth and good,
is inseparable from the nature of an intellectual being—what right
have we then to catch at every strife which in the mortified professors
of religion the spirit wages with the flesh as grossly vicious, or at
every doubt, the bare suggestion of which fills them with consternation
and despair, as a proof of the most glaring hypocrisy? The grossnesses
of religion and its stickling for mere forms as its essence, have
given a handle, and a just one, to its impugners. At the feast of
Ramadan (says Voltaire) the Mussulmans wash and pray five times a
day, and then fall to cutting one another’s throats again with the greatest
deliberation and good-will. The two things, I grant, are sufficiently
at variance; but they are, I contend, equally sincere in both. The
Mahometans are savages, but they are not the less true believers—they
hate their enemies as heartily as they revere the Koran. This,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>instead of showing the fallacy of the <em>ideal</em> principle, shows its
universality and indestructible essence. Let a man be as bad as he
will, as little refined as possible, and indulge whatever hurtful passions
or gross vices he thinks proper, these cannot occupy the whole of his
time; and in the intervals between one scoundrel action and another
he may and must have better thoughts, and may have recourse to
those of religion (true or false) among the number, without in this
being guilty of hypocrisy or of making a jest of what is considered as
sacred. This, I take it, is the whole secret of Methodism, which is
a sort of modern vent for the ebullitions of the spirit through the gaps
of unrighteousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>We often see that a person condemns in another the very thing he
is guilty of himself. Is this hypocrisy? It may, or it may not. If
he really feels none of the disgust and abhorrence he expresses, this is
quackery and impudence. But if he really expresses what he feels,
(and he easily may, for it is the abstract idea he contemplates in the
case of another, and the immediate temptation to which he yields in
his own, so that he probably is not even conscious of the identity or
connexion between the two,) then this is not hypocrisy, but want of
strength and keeping in the moral sense. All morality consists in
squaring our actions and sentiments to our ideas of what is fit and
proper; and it is the incessant struggle and alternate triumph of the
two principles, the <em>ideal</em> and the physical, that keeps up this ‘mighty
coil and pudder’ about vice and virtue, and is one great source of all
the good and evil in the world. The mind of man is like a clock
that is always running down, and requires to be as constantly wound
up. The <em>ideal</em> principle is the master-key that winds it up, and without
which it would come to a stand: the sensual and selfish feelings
are the dead weights that pull it down to the gross and grovelling.
Till the intellectual faculty is destroyed, (so that the mind sees
nothing beyond itself, or the present moment,) it is impossible to have
all brutal depravity: till the material and physical are done away
with, (so that it shall contemplate everything from a purely spiritual
and disinterested point of view,) it is impossible to have all virtue.
There must be a mixture of the two, as long as man is compounded
of opposite materials, a contradiction and an eternal competition for
the mastery. I by no means think a single bad action condemns a
man, for he probably condemns it as much as you do; nor a single
bad habit, for he is probably trying all his life to get rid of it. A man
is only thoroughly profligate when he has lost the sense of right and
wrong; or a thorough hypocrite, when he has not even the wish to
be what he appears. The greatest offence against virtue is to speak
ill of it. To recommend certain things is worse than to practise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>them. There may be an excuse for the last in the frailty of passion;
but the former can arise from nothing but an utter depravity of disposition.
Any one may yield to temptation, and yet feel a sincere
love and aspiration after virtue: but he who maintains vice in theory,
has not even the conception or capacity for virtue in his mind. Men
err: fiends only make a mock at goodness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The London Weekly Review.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>December 13, 1828.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>We sometimes deceive ourselves, and think worse of human nature
than it deserves, in consequence of judging of character from names,
and classes, and modes of life. No one is simply and absolutely any
one thing, though he may be branded with it as a name. Some
persons have expected to see his crimes written in the face of a murderer,
and have been disappointed because they did not, as if this
impeached the distinction between virtue and vice. Not at all. The
circumstance only showed that the man was other things, and had
other feelings besides those of a murderer. If he had nothing else,—if
he had fed on nothing else,—if he had dreamt of nothing else, but
schemes of murder, his features would have expressed nothing else:
but this perfection in vice is not to be expected from the contradictory
and mixed nature of our motives. Humanity is to be met with in a
den of robbers; nay, modesty in a brothel. Even among the most
abandoned of the other sex, there is not unfrequently found to exist
(contrary to all that is generally supposed) one strong and individual
attachment, which remains unshaken to the last. Virtue may be said
to steal, like a guilty thing, into the secret haunts of vice and infamy;
it clings to their devoted victim, and will not be driven quite away.
Nothing can destroy the human heart. Again, there is a heroism in
crime, as well as in virtue. Vice and infamy have also their altars
and their religion. This makes nothing in their favour, but is a proof
of the heroical disinterestedness of man’s nature, and that whatever
he does, he must fling a dash of romance and sublimity into it; just
as some grave biographer has said of Shakespeare, that ‘even when he
killed a calf, he made a speech and did it in a great style.’</p>

<p class='c007'>It is then impossible to get rid of this original distinction and
contradictory bias, and to reduce everything to the system of French
levity and Epicurean indifference. Wherever there is a capacity of
conceiving of things as different from what they are, there must be a
principle of taste and selection—a disposition to make them better,
and a power to make them worse. Ask a Parisian milliner if she
does not think one bonnet more becoming than another—a Parisian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>dancing-master if French grace is not better than English awkwardness—a
French cook if all sauces are alike—a French <em>blacklegs</em> if all
throws are equal on the dice? It is curious that the French nation
restrict rigid rules and fixed principles to cookery and the drama, and
maintain that the great drama of human life is entirely a matter of
caprice and fancy. No one will assert that Raphael’s histories, that
Claude’s landscapes are not better than a daub: but if the expression
in one of Raphael’s faces is better than the most mean and vulgar,
how resist the consequence that the feeling so expressed is better also?
It does not appear to me that all faces or all actions are alike. If
goodness were only a theory, it were a pity it should be lost to the
world. There are a number of things, the idea of which is a clear
gain to the mind. Let people, for instance, rail at friendship, genius,
freedom, as long as they will—the very names of these despised
qualities are better than anything else that could be substituted for
them, and embalm even the most envenomed satire against them. It
is no small consideration that the mind is capable even of feigning
such things. So I would contend against that reasoning which would
have it thought that if religion is not true, there is no difference
between mankind and the beasts that perish;—I should say, that this
distinction is equally proved, if religion is supposed to be a mere
fabrication of the human mind; the capacity to conceive it makes the
difference. The idea alone of an over-ruling Providence, or of a
future state, is as much a distinctive mark of a superiority of nature,
as the invention of the mathematics, which are true,—or of poetry,
which is a fable. Whatever the truth or falsehood of our speculations,
the power to make them is peculiar to ourselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contrariety and warfare of different faculties and dispositions
within us has not only given birth to the Manichean and Gnostic
heresies, and to other superstitions of the East, but will account for
many of the mummeries and dogmas both of Popery and Calvinism,—confession,
absolution, justification by faith, &#38;c.; which, in the
hopelessness of attaining perfection, and our dissatisfaction with ourselves
for falling short of it, are all substitutes for actual virtue, and
an attempt to throw the burthen of a task, to which we are unequal
or only half disposed, on the merits of others, or on outward forms,
ceremonies, and professions of faith. Hence the crowd of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>‘Eremites and friars,</div>
      <div class='line'>White, black, and grey, with all their trumpery.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If we do not conform to the law, we at least acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the court. A person does wrong; he is sorry for it;
and as he still feels himself liable to error, he is desirous to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>atonement as well as he can, by ablutions, by tithes, by penance, by
sacrifices, or other voluntary demonstrations of obedience, which are
in his power, though his passions are not, and which prove that his
will is not refractory, and that his understanding is right towards God.
The stricter tenets of Calvinism, which allow of no medium between
grace and reprobation, and doom man to eternal punishment for every
breach of the moral law, as an equal offence against infinite truth and
justice, proceed (like the paradoxical doctrine of the Stoics) from
taking a half-view of this subject, and considering man as amenable
only to the dictates of his understanding and his conscience, and not
excusable from the temptations and frailty of human ignorance and
passion. The mixing up of religion and morality together, or the
making us accountable for every word, thought, or action, under no
less a responsibility than our everlasting future welfare or misery, has
also added incalculably to the difficulties of self-knowledge, has superinduced
a violent and spurious state of feeling, and made it almost
impossible to distinguish the boundaries between the true and false, in
judging of human conduct and motives. A religious man is afraid of
looking into the state of his soul, lest at the same time he should
reveal it to Heaven; and tries to persuade himself that by shutting
his eyes to his true character and feelings, they will remain a profound
secret both here and hereafter. This is a strong engine and irresistible
inducement to self-deception; and the more zealous any one is in
his convictions of the truth of religion, the more we may suspect the
sincerity of his pretensions to piety and morality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, though I think there is very little downright hypocrisy in
the world, I do think there is a great deal of <em>cant</em>—‘cant religious,
cant political, cant literary,’ &#38;c. as Lord Byron said. Though few
people have the face to set up for the very thing they in their hearts
despise, we almost all want to be thought better than we are, and affect
a greater admiration or abhorrence of certain things than we really
feel. Indeed, some degree of affectation is as necessary to the mind
as dress is to the body; we must overact our part in some measure,
in order to produce any effect at all. There was formerly the two
hours’ sermon, the long-winded grace, the nasal drawl, the uplifted
hands and eyes; all which, though accompanied with some corresponding
emotion, expressed more than was really felt, and were in
fact intended to make up for the conscious deficiency. As our
interest in anything wears out with time and habit, we exaggerate the
outward symptoms of zeal as mechanical helps to devotion, dwell the
longer on our words as they are less felt, and hence the very origin
of the term, <em>cant</em>. The cant of sentimentality has succeeded to that
of religion. There is a cant of humanity, of patriotism and loyalty—not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>that people do not feel these emotions, but they make too great a
<em>fuss</em> about them, and drawl out the expression of them till they tire
themselves and others. There is a cant about Shakespeare. There
is a cant about <em>Political Economy</em> just now. In short, there is and
must be a cant about everything that excites a considerable degree of
attention and interest, and that people would be thought to know and
care rather more about than they actually do. Cant is the voluntary
overcharging or prolongation of a real sentiment; hypocrisy is the
setting up a pretension to a feeling you never had and have no wish for.
Mr. Coleridge is made up of <em>cant</em>, that is, of mawkish affectation and
sensibility; but he has not sincerity enough to be a <em>hypocrite</em>, that is,
he has not hearty dislike or contempt enough for anything, to give
the lie to his puling professions of admiration and esteem for it. The
fuss that Mr. Liberal Snake makes about Political Economy is not
cant, but what Mr. Theodore Hook politely calls <em>humbug</em>; he himself
is hardly the dupe of his own pompous reasoning, but he wishes
to make it the <em>stalking-horse</em> of his ambition or interest to sneak into
a place and curry favour with the Government....</p>

<p class='c006'>As there are two kinds of rhyme, one that is rhyme to the ear, and
another to the eye only; so there may be said to be two kinds of
poetry, one that is a description of objects to those who have never
seen or but slightly studied them; the other is a description of objects
addressed to those who have seen and are intimately acquainted
with them, and expressing the feeling which is the result of such
knowledge. It is needless to add that the first kind of poetry is
comparatively superficial and common-place; the last profound, lofty,
nay often divine. Take an example (one out of a thousand) from
Shakspeare. In enumerating the wished-for contents of her basket of
flowers, <em>Perdita</em> in the <em>Winter’s Tale</em> mentions among others——</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>This passage which knocks down John Bull with its perfumed and
melting softness, and savours of ‘that fine madness which our first
poets had,’ is a mystery, an <em>untranslateable</em> language, to all France:
Racine could not have conceived what it was about—the stupidest
Englishman feels a certain pride and pleasure in it. What a privilege
(if that were all) to be born on this the cloudy and poetical side of the
Channel! We may in part clear up this contradiction in tastes by the
clue above given. The French are more apt at taking the patterns of
their ideas from words; we, who are slower and heavier, are obliged
to look closer at things before we can pronounce upon them at all,
which in the end perhaps opens a larger field both of observation and
fancy. Thus the phrase ‘violets <em>dim</em>,’ to those who have never seen
the object, or who, having paid no attention to it, refer to the description
for their notion of it, seems to convey a slur rather than a
compliment, dimness being no beauty in itself; so this part of the
story would not have been ventured upon in French or tinsel poetry.
But to those who have seen, and been as it were enamoured of the
little hedge-row candidate for applause, looking at it again and again
(as misers contemplate their gold—as fine ladies hang over their jewels),
till its image has sunk into the soul, what other word is there that (far
from putting the reader out of conceit with it) so well recals its deep
purple glow, its retired modesty, its sullen, conscious beauty? Those
who have not seen the flower cannot form an idea of its character,
nor understand the line without it. Its aspect is dull, obtuse, faint,
absorbed; but at the same time soft, luxurious, proud, and full of
meaning. People who look at nature without being sensible to these
distinctions and contrarieties of feeling, had better (instead of the
flower) look only at the label on the stalk. Connoisseurs in French
wines pretend to know all these depths and refinements of taste,
though connoisseurs in French poetry pretend to know them not.
To return to our text——</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>How <em>bizarre</em>! cries one hypercritic. What far-fetched metaphors!
exclaims another. We shall not dwell on the allusion to ‘Cytherea’s
breath,’ it is obvious enough: but how can the violet’s smell be said
to be ‘sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes?’ Oh! honeyed words,
how ill understood! And is there no true and rooted analogy
between our different sensations, as well as a positive and literal
identity? Is there not a sugared, melting, half-sleepy look in some
eyelids, like the luscious, languid smell of flowers? How otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>express that air of scorn and tenderness which breathes from them?
Is there not a balmy dew upon them which one would kiss off?
Speak, ye lovers! if any such remain in these degenerate days to
take the part of genuine poetry against cold, barren criticism; for
poetry is nothing but an intellectual love——Nature is the poet’s
mistress, and the heart in his case lends words and harmonious utterance
to the tongue.——Again, how full of truth and pity is the turn
which is given to the description of the pale and faded primrose,
watching for the sun’s approach as for the torch of Hymen! Milton
has imitated this not so well in ‘cowslips wan that hang the pensive
head.’ Cowslips are of a gold colour, rather than wan. In speaking
of the daffodils, it seems as if our poet had been struck with these
‘lowly children of the ground’ on their first appearance, and seeing
what bright and unexpected guests they were at that cold, comfortless
season, wondered how ‘they came before the swallow (the
harbinger of summer) dared,’ and being the only lovely thing in
nature, fancied the winds of March were taken with them, and tamed
their fury at the sight. No one but a poet who has spent his youth
in the company of nature could so describe it, as no reader who has
not experienced the same elementary sensations, their combinations
and contrasts, can properly enter into it when so described. The
finest poetry, then, is not a paradox nor a trite paraphrase; but a bold
and happy enunciation of truths and feelings deeply implanted in the
mind——Apollo, the god of poetry and day, evolving the thoughts
of the breast, as he does the seed from the frozen earth, or enables
the flower to burst its folds. Poetry is, indeed, a fanciful structure;
but a fanciful structure raised on the ground-work of the strongest and
most intimate associations of our ideas: otherwise, it is good for
nothing, <em>vox et preterea nihil</em>. A literal description goes for nothing
in poetry, a pure fiction is of as little worth; but it is the extreme
beauty and power of an impression with all its accompaniments, or the
very intensity and truth of feeling, that pushes the poet over the verge
of matter-of-fact, and justifies him in resorting to the licence of fiction
to express what without his ‘winged words’ must have remained for
ever untold. Thus the feeling of the contrast between the roughness
and bleakness of the winds of March and the tenderness and beauty
of the flowers of spring is already in the reader’s mind, if he be an
observer of nature: the poet, to show the utmost extent and conceivable
effect of this contrast, <em>feigns</em> that the winds themselves are
sensible of it and smit with the beauty on which they commit such
rude assaults. Lord Byron, whose imagination was not of this compound
character, and more wilful than natural, produced splendid
exaggerations. Mr. Shelley, who felt the want of originality without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>the power to supply it, distorted every thing from what it was, and
his pen produced only abortions. The one would say that the sun
was a ‘ball of dazzling fire;’ the other, not knowing what to say, but
determined ‘to elevate and surprize,’ would swear that it was <em>black</em>.
This latter class of poetry may be denominated the <em>Apocalyptical</em>.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ENGLISH GRAMMAR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>March 15, 1829.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>This is one of those subjects on which the human understanding has
played the fool, almost as egregiously, though with less dire consequences,
than on many others; or rather one on which it has not
chosen to exert itself at all, being hoodwinked and led blindfold by
mere precedent and authority. Scholars who have made and taught
from English grammars were previously and systematically initiated in
the Greek and Latin tongues, so that they have, without deigning to
notice the difference, taken the rules of the latter and applied them
indiscriminately and dogmatically to the former. As well might
they pretend that there is a <em>dual number</em> in the Latin language because
there is one in the Greek.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Definitions</em> alone are able to corrupt a whole generation of
ingenuous youth. They seem calculated for no other purpose than to
<em>mystify</em> and <em>stultify</em> the understanding, and to inoculate it betimes with
a due portion of credulity and verbal sophistry. After repeating them
by rote, to maintain that two and two makes five is easy, and a thing
of course. What appears most extraordinary is that notwithstanding
the complete exposure of their fallacy and nonsense by Horne Tooke
and others, the same system and method of instruction should be
persisted in; and that grammar succeeds grammar and edition edition,
re-echoing the same point-blank contradictions and shallow terms.
Establishments and endowments of learning (which subsist on a
‘foregone conclusion’) may have something to do with it; independently
of which, and for each person’s individual solace, the more
senseless the absurdity and the longer kept up, the more reluctant does
the mind seem to part with it, whether in the greatest things or mere
trifles and technicalities; for in the latter, as the retracting an error
could produce no startling sensation, and be accompanied with no
redeeming enthusiasm, its detection must be a pure loss and pitiful
mortification. One might suppose, that out of so many persons as
have their attention directed to this subject, some few would find out
their mistake and protest against the common practice; but the greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>the number of professional labourers in the vineyard, who seek not
truth but a livelihood, and can <em>pay with words</em> more currently than
with things, the less chance must there be of this, since the majority
will always set their faces against it, and insist upon the old <em>Mumpsimus</em>
in preference to the new <em>Sumpsimus</em>. A schoolmaster who should go
so far out of his way as to take the Diversions of Purley for a text-book,
would be regarded by his brethren of the rod as ‘a man of Ind,’
and would soon have the dogs of the village bark at him. It is said
without blushing, by both masters and ushers who do not chuse to be
‘wise above what is written,’ that a noun is the name of a <em>thing</em>, <em>i.e.</em>
substance, as if <em>love</em>, <em>honour</em>, <em>colour</em>, were the names of substances. An
adjective is defined to be the name of a quality; and yet in the
expressions, a <em>gold</em> snuff-box, a <em>wooden</em> spoon, an <em>iron</em> chest, &#38;c., the
words <em>gold</em>, <em>wooden</em>, <em>iron</em>, are allowed by all these profound writers,
grammarians, and logicians, to be essentially adjectives. A verb is
likewise defined to be a word denoting <em>being</em>, <em>action</em>, or <em>suffering</em>; and
yet the words <em>being</em>, <em>action</em>, <em>suffering</em> (or passion), are all substantives;
so that these words cannot be supposed to have any reference to the
things whose names they bear, if it be the peculiar and sole office of the
verb to denote them. If a system were made in burlesque and
purposely to call into question and expose its own nakedness, it could
not go beyond this, which is gravely taught in all seminaries, and
patiently learnt by all school-boys as an exercise and discipline of the
intellectual faculties. Again, it is roundly asserted that there are
<em>six cases</em> (why not seven?) in the English language; and a case is
defined to be a peculiar termination or inflection added to a noun to
show its position in the sentence. Now in the Latin language there
are no doubt a number of cases, inasmuch as there are a number of
inflections;<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c008'><sup>[56]</sup></a> and for the same reason (if words have a meaning) in the
English Language there are none, or only one, the genitive; because
if we except this, there is no inflection or variety whatever in the terminations.
Thus to instance in the present noun—A case, Of a case,
To a case, A case, O case, From a case—they tell you that the word
<em>case</em> is here its own nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative,
and ablative, though the deuce of any case—that is inflection of the
noun—is there in the case. Nevertheless, many a pedagogue would
swear till he was black in the face that it is so; and would lie awake
many a restless night boiling with rage and vexation that any one should
be so lost to shame and reason as to suspect that there is here also a distinction
without a difference. In strictness, in the Latin word there are
only four, <em>casus</em>, <em>casui</em>, <em>casum</em>, <em>casu</em>; and the rest are conceded out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>uniformity with other cases where the terminations are six times varied:<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c008'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
but why insist on the full complement, where there is no case in the
whole language (but for the arbitrary one already excepted) to bear it
out? Again, it is agreed on all hands, that English nouns have genders.
Except with a few, where the termination is borrowed from another
language, such as <em>Empress</em>, &#38;c., there is no possibility of generally
telling the sex implied from the form of the termination: but men
looking at the point with their Latin eyes, see genders wherever they
have been accustomed to find them in a foreign tongue. The difference
of sex is vernacularly conveyed in English by a different word—<em>man</em>,
<em>woman</em>, <em>stag</em>, <em>deer</em>, <em>king</em>, <em>queen</em>, &#38;c.; and there is no such thing
as conventional gender in neutral things—<em>house</em>, <em>church</em>, <em>field</em>, and so
on. All this might be excusable as a prejudice or oversight; but
then why persist in it in the thirty-eighth edition of a standard book
published by the great firm in Paternoster-row? We sometimes
think mankind have a propensity to lying not more in matters-of-fact
than theory. They maintain what they know to be without a shadow
of foundation, and in the sheer spirit of contradiction, or because they
hate to be convinced. In the same manner as the cases and genders
of nouns, the whole ramification of the verb is constructed, and hung
up for the admiration of the credulous upon the ideal of the Latin and
Greek verb, with all its tenses, persons, moods, and participles,
whether there be anything more than a mere skeleton of a resemblance
to suspend all this learned patch-work upon or not. ‘I <em>love</em>, thou <em>lovest</em>
he <em>loves</em>; we, ye, they <em>love</em>.’ There is a difference in the three first,
so that from announcing the verb, you know the prefix; but in the three
last, what difference is there, what sign of separation from one
another, or from the first person singular? ‘I <em>loved</em>’ is the past
tense doubtless: it is a difference of inflection denoting time: but ‘I
<em>did</em> love, I <em>have loved</em>, I <em>will</em>, <em>can</em>, <em>shall</em>, <em>would</em> love,’ are not properly
tenses or moods of the verb <em>love</em>, but other verbs with the
infinitive or participle of the first verb appended to them. Thus is
our irregular verb professionally licked into regularity and shape.
When the thing is wanting it is supplied by the name. <em>Empedocles
was a cobbler, even when he did not cobble.</em> A conjunction is held to
be a part of speech without any meaning in itself, but that serves to
connect sentences together, such as <em>that</em>, <em>and</em>, &#38;c. It is proved by Mr.
Horne Tooke, that the conjunction <em>that</em> is no other than the pronoun <em>that</em>
(with the words <em>thing</em> or <em>proposition</em> understood)—as <em>and</em> is the imperative
of the old Saxon verb <em>anandad</em> (to add), upon a similar principle—‘I
say this <em>and</em> (or add) that’—and though it is above fifty years
since this luminous discovery was published to the world, no hint of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>it has crept into any Grammar used in schools, and by authority. It
seems to be taken for granted that all sound and useful knowledge
is by rote, and that if it ceased to be so, the Church and State might
crumble to pieces like the conjunctions <em>and</em> and <em>that</em>. There may be
some truth in that.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is strange that Mr. Horne Tooke, with all his logical and
etymological acuteness, should have been so bad a metaphysician as to
argue that all language was merely a disjointed tissue of names of
objects (with certain abbreviations), and that he should have given or
attempted no definition of the verb. He barely hints at it in one
place, <em>viz.</em>—that the verb is <em>quod loquimur</em>, the noun <em>de quo</em>; that is,
the noun expresses the name of any thing or points out the object;
the verb signifies the opinion or will of the speaker concerning it.
What then becomes of the <em>infinitive mood</em>, which neither affirms,
denies, nor commands any thing, but is left like a log of wood in the
high road of grammar, to be picked up by the first jaunting-car of
‘winged words’ that comes that way with its moods, persons, and
tenses, flying, and turned to any use that may be wanted? Mr.
Tooke was in the habit of putting off his guests at Wimbledon with
promising to explain some <em>puzzle</em> the following Sunday; and he left
the world in the dark as to the definition of the verb, much in the
same spirit of <em>badinage</em> and mystery. We do not know when the
deficiency is likely to be supplied, unless it has been done by Mr.
Fearn in his little work called Anti-Tooke. We have not seen the
publication, but we know the author to be a most able and ingenious
man, and capable of lighting upon nice distinctions which few but
himself would ever dream of. An excess of modesty, which doubts
every thing, is much more favourable to the discovery of truth than
that spirit of dogmatism which presumptuously takes every thing for
granted; but at the same time it is not equally qualified to place its
conclusions in the most advantageous and imposing light; and we
accordingly too often find our quacks and impostors collecting a crowd
with their drums, trumpets, and <em>placards</em> of themselves at the end of
a street, while the ‘still, small’ pipe of truth and simplicity is
drowned in the loud din and bray, or forced to retire to a distance to
solace itself with its own low tones and fine-drawn distinctions.
Having touched upon this subject, we may be allowed to add that
some of our most eminent writers, as, for instance, Mr. Maculloch
with his <em>Principles of Political Economy</em>, and Mr. Mill with his
<em>Elements of Political Economy</em>, remind us of two barrel-organ grinders
in the same street, playing the same tune and contending for precedence
and mastery. What is Mozart to any of the four?</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MEMORABILIA OF MR. COLERIDGE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>March 22, 1829.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>He said of an old cathedral, that it always appeared to him like a
<em>petrified religion</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hearing some one observe that the religious sentiments introduced
in Sheridan’s <em>Pizarro</em> met with great applause on the stage, he replied,
that he thought this a sure sign of the decay of religion; for when
people began to patronise it as an amiable theatrical sentiment, they
had no longer any real faith in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>He said of a Mr. H——, a friend of Fox’s, who always put himself
forward to interpret the great orator’s sentiments, and almost took
the words out of his mouth, that it put him in mind of the steeple of
St. Thomas, on Ludgate-hill, which is constantly getting in the way
when you wish to see the dome of St. Paul’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seeing a little soiled copy of Thomson’s <cite>Seasons</cite> lying in the
window-seat of an obscure inn on the sea-coast of Somersetshire, he
said, ‘<em>That</em> is true fame.’</p>

<p class='c007'>He observed of some friend, that he had <em>thought himself</em> out of a
handsome face, and into a fine one.</p>

<p class='c007'>He said of the French, that they received and gave out sensations
too quickly, to be a people of imagination. He thought Moliere’s
father must have been an Englishman.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Mr. Coleridge, common rhetoricians argued by
metaphors; Burke reasoned <em>in</em> them.</p>

<p class='c007'>He considered acuteness as a <em>shop-boy</em> quality compared with
subtlety of mind; and quoted Paine as an example of the first,
Berkeley as the perfection of the last.</p>

<p class='c007'>He extolled Bishop Butler’s <em>Sermons at the Rolls’ Chapel</em> as full of
thought and sound views of philosophy; and conceived that he had
proved the love of piety and virtue to be as natural to the mind of
man as the delight it receives from the colour of a rose or the smell
of a lily. He spoke of the <em>Analysis</em> as theological special-pleading.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had no opinion of Hume, and very idly disputed his originality.
He said the whole of his argument on miracles was to be found
stated (as an objection) somewhere in Barrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>He said Thomson was a true poet, but an indolent one. He
seldom wrote a good line, but he ‘rewarded resolution’ by following
it up with a bad one. Cowper he regarded as the reformer of the
Della Cruscan style in poetry, and the founder of the modern school.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being asked which he thought the greater man, Milton or Shakspeare,
he replied that he could hardly venture to pronounce an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>opinion—that Shakspeare appeared to him to have the strength, the
stature of his rival, with infinitely more agility; but that he could not
bring himself after all to look upon Shakspeare as any thing more
than a beardless stripling, and that if he had ever arrived at man’s
estate, he would not have been a man but a monster of intellect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being told that Mrs. Wolstonecraft exerted a very great ascendancy
over the mind of her husband, he said—‘It was always the
case: people of imagination naturally took the lead of people of mere
understanding and acquirement.’ This was scarcely doing justice to
the author of <cite>Caleb Williams</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>He spoke of Mackintosh as deficient in original resources: he was
neither the great merchant nor manufacturer of intellectual riches;
but the ready warehouseman, who had a large assortment of goods,
not properly his own, and who knew where to lay his hand on whatever
he wanted. An argument which he had sustained for three
hours together with another erudite person on some grand question of
philosophy, being boasted of in Coleridge’s hearing as a mighty
achievement, the latter bluntly answered—‘Had there been a man
of genius among you, he would have settled the point in five
minutes.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Having been introduced to a well-known wit and professed jester,
and his own silence being complained of, he said he should no more
think of speaking where Mr. —— was present, than of interrupting
an actor on the stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Coleridge preferred Salvator Rosa to Claude, therein erring.
He however spoke eloquently and feelingly of pictures, where the
subject-matter was poetical, and where ‘more was meant than met
the eye.’ Thus he described the allegorical picture by Giotto in the
cemetery at Pisa, the <em>Triumph of Death</em>, where the rich, the young,
and the prosperous, are shrinking in horror and dismay from the grim
monster; and the wretched, the cripple, and the beggar, are invoking
his friendly aid, both in words and tones worthy of the subject.
Mr. Coleridge’s was the only conversation we ever heard in which
the ideas seemed set to music—it had the materials of philosophy
and the sound of music; or if the thoughts were sometimes poor and
worthless, the accompaniment was always fine.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stated of Henderson, the actor, or some person of whom a
very indifferent jest was repeated, that it was the strongest proof of his
ability, and of the good things he <em>must have said</em> to make his bad
ones pass current.</p>

<p class='c007'>He characterised the <em>Prometheus Bound</em> of Æschylus, as being less
a drama than an <em>Ode to Justice</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>He said that formerly men concealed their vices; but now, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>change of manners and the laxity of theories, they boasted of those
they had not.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sometimes told a story well, though but rarely. He used to
speak with some drollery and unction of his meeting in his tour in
Germany with a Lutheran clergyman, who expressed a great curiosity
about the fate of Dr. Dodd in a Latin gibberish which he could not
at first understand. ‘<i><span lang="la">Doctorem Tott, Doctorem Tott! Infelix homo,
collo suspensus!</span></i>‘—he called out in an agony of suspense, fitting the
action to the word, and the idea of the reverend divine just then
occurring to Mr. Coleridge’s imagination. The Germans have a
strange superstition that Dr. Dodd is still wandering in disguise in
the Hartz forest in Germany; and his <em>Prison Thoughts</em> are a favourite
book with the initiated.</p>

<p class='c007'>If these remarkable sayings are fewer than the reader might expect,
they are all we remember; and we might avail ourselves of the
answer which Quevedo puts into the mouth of the door-keeper of
Hell, when the poet is surprised to find so few kings in his custody—‘There
are all that ever existed!’</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PETER PINDAR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>April 5, 1829.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>This celebrated wit and character lived to a great age, and retained
his spirit and faculties to the last. In person he did not at all answer
to Mr. Cobbett’s description of authors, as a lean, starveling, puny
race—‘men made after supper of a cheese-paring’—he was large,
robust, portly, and florid; or in Chaucer’s phrase,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A manly man to ben an abbot able.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In his latter years he was blind, and had his head close shaved; and
as he sat bare-headed, presented the appearance of a fine old monk—a
Luther or a <em>Friar John</em>, with the gravity of the one and the wit
and fiery turbulence of the other. Peter had something clerical in
his aspect: he looked like a venerable father of poetry, or an
unworthy son of the church, equally fitted to indict a homily and
preach a crusade, or to point an epigram, and was evidently one of
those children of Momus in whom the good things of the body had
laid the foundation of and given birth to the good things of the mind.
He was one of the few authors who did not disappoint the expectations
raised of them on a nearer acquaintance; and the reason probably
was what has been above hinted at, namely, that he did not take to
this calling from nervous despondency and constitutional poverty of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>spirit, but from the fulness and exuberance of his intellectual resources
and animal spirits. Our satirist was not a mere wit, but a man of strong
sense and observation, critical, argumentative, a good declaimer, and
with a number of acquirements of various kinds. His poetry, instead
of having absorbed all the little wit he had (which is so often the case),
was but ‘the sweepings of his mind.’ He said just as good things
every hour in the day. He was the life and soul of the company
where he was—told a story admirably, gave his opinion freely, spoke
equally well, and with thorough knowledge of poetry, painting, or
music, could ‘haloo an anthem’ with stentorian lungs in imitation of
the whole chorus of children at St. Paul’s, or bring the black population
of the West Indies before you like a swarm of flies in a sugar-basin,
by his manner of describing their antics and odd noises. Dr.
Wolcot’s conversation was rich and powerful (not to say overpowering)—there
was an extreme unction about it, but a certain tincture of
grossness. His criticism was his best. We remember in particular
his making an excellent analysis of Dryden’s <cite>Alexander’s Feast</cite> in a
controversy on its merits with Mr. Curran; and as a specimen of his
<em>parallelisms</em> between the sister-arts, he used to say of Viotti (the
celebrated violin-player), that ‘he was the Michael Angelo of the
fiddle.’ He had a heresy in painting, which was, that Claude
Lorraine was inferior to Wilson; but the orthodox believers were
obliged to be silent before him. A short time before his death he
had a private lodging at Somers’ Town, where he received a few
friends. He sat and talked familiarly and cheerfully, asking you
whether you thought his head would not make a fine bust? He had
a decanter of rum placed on the table before him, from which he
poured out a glass-full as he wanted it and drank it pure, taking no
other beverage, but not exceeding in this. His infirmities had made
no alteration in his conversation, except perhaps a little more timidity
and hesitation; for blindness is the <em>lameness</em> of the mind. He could
not see the effect of what he said lighting up the countenances of
others; and in this case, the tongue may run on the faster, but hardly
so well. After coffee, which he accompanied with the due quantity
of <em>merum sal</em>, he would ask to be led down into a little parlour below,
which was hung round with some early efforts of his own in landscape-painting,
and with some of Wilson’s unfinished sketches. Though
he could see them no longer, otherwise than in his mind’s eye, he
was evidently pleased to be in the room with them, as they brought
back former associations. Youth and age seem glad to meet as it
were on the last hill-top of life, to shake hands once more and part
for ever! He spoke slightingly of his own performances (though
they were by no means contemptible), but launched out with great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>fervour in praise of his favourite Wilson, and in disparagement of
Claude, enlarging on the fine broad manner and bold effects of the
one, and on the finical littleness of the other, and ‘making the worse
appear the better reason.’ It was here we last parted with this fine
old man, and it is with mixed pleasure and regret we turn to the
subject. Peter Pindar, besides his vein of comic humour, excelled
when he chose in the serious and pathetic; and his ‘Lines to a Fly
drowned in Treacle,’ and ‘To an Expiring Taper,’ are among his
best pieces.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LOGIC</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>April 12, 1829.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>Much has been said and written of the importance of logic to the
advancement of truth and learning, but not altogether convincingly.
Its use is chiefly confined by some to being a guide to the mind when
first feeling its way out of the night of ignorance and barbarism, or a
curb to the wilful and restive spirit that is a rebel to reason and
common sense. But the extent of the benefit in either case may be
doubted; since the rude and uninstructed will not submit to artificial
trammels, or get up into this <em>go-cart</em> of the understanding, and the
perverse and obstinate will jump out of it whenever their prejudices
or passions are wound up to a height to make its restraints necessary.
The wilful man will have his way in spite of the dictates of his reason
or the evidence of his senses either. The study of logic has been
compared to the getting ready and sharpening the tools with which
the mind works out the truth; but all that is of value in it is more
like the natural use of our hands, or resembles the mould in which
truth must be cast, and which is born with us, rather than an external
instrument with which it must be fashioned; for all syllogisms reduce
themselves either to identical propositions, or to certain forms and
relations of ideas in the understanding, which are antecedent to, and
absolutely govern, our conclusions with the rules for drawing them.
The mind cannot <em>make an instrument to make truth</em>, as it contrives an
instrument to make a certain object; for in the latter case, the object
depends upon the act and will of the mind; but in the former, the
mind is passive to the impression of given objects upon it, and this
depends on certain laws over which it has itself no control. Logic
at best only lays down the rules and laws by which our reason
operates; but it must operate according to those rules and laws
equally whether they are adverted to or not, or they could not be
laid down as infallible. Truth is, in a word, the shape which our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>ideas take in the moulds of the understanding, just as the potter’s clay
derives its figure (whether round or square) from the mould in which
it is cast. Thus, if we are told that one wine-glass is less than
another, and that the larger wine-glass is less than a third, we know
that the third wine-glass is larger than the first, without either comparing
them or having any general rule to prove it by. We can no
more conceive it otherwise, or do away that regular gradation and
proportion between the objects so defined and characterised, than we
can imagine the same thing to grow bigger and become less at the
same time. Reasoning is allowed (at least by the schoolmen and the
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, though not by our wise
sceptical moderns) to be the linking of one judgment on to two
others: <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> being given, why then something else follows.
Thus, suppose two roads to take a diverging direction, you are sure,
without measuring, that the farther you go in the one, the farther you
get from the other. You know that you advance: you <em>infer</em> that
you recede. Now the difficulty lies here—if the premises are the
same with the conclusion, it amounts only to an identical proposition:
if they are different, what is the connection between them? But in
the example just given, there are two circumstances, or properties,
stated at the outset of the question, <em>viz.</em>—not merely the existence, but
the direction, of the road; and to sustain the inference, all that seems
necessary is, that both these circumstances should be borne in mind.
For if the road do not continue to <em>diverge</em>, the conclusion will not hold
good; and if it still continue to diverge, what is this but saying, not
only that it advances, but that it advances in a direction which, by the
supposition, carries it farther at every step from the former road? That
is, two things are affirmed of a given object; the mind sets out with
a complex proposition, and what it has to do is not to forget one half
of it by the way. It would be long enough before the abstract idea of
a road would imply its distance from another; but it would also be
hard if a diverging road—that is, a road that recedes while it advances—did
not recede. A mathematical line and its direction are not two
things, like the feet of a pair of compasses—that while the line is
moving one way, the direction may be going astray in another—but
mutually implied and inseparably connected together in nature or the
understanding—let the <em>realists</em> or <em>idealists</em> determine which they please.
Or, as the wise man said to the daughter of King Cophetua, ‘That
which is, is; for what is <em>that</em> but <em>that</em>, and <em>is</em> but <em>is</em>?’<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c008'><sup>[58]</sup></a> The worst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>of the matter is, that the most important conclusions are not to be so
easily enclosed in pews and forms of words and definitions; and that
to catch the truth as it flies, is as nice a point as hedging the cuckoo:
though they say that its wings have been lately clipped and a pound
built for it somewhere in Westminster. Not to proceed farther in
this subject, and get ‘over shoes, over boots’ in the mire of metaphysics,
we shall conclude this article with what we meant to state at
the commencement of it, to wit—that the commonest form of the
syllogism is the worst of all, being a downright fallacy and <em>petitio
principii</em>. It consists in including the individual in the species, and
runs thus: ‘All men are mortal; John is a man; therefore John is
mortal.’ Let any one deny this at his peril; but what is, or can be
gained by such parroting? The first branch of the premises takes for
granted and supposes that you already know all that you want to prove
in the conclusion. For before you are entitled to assert roundly that
all men are mortal, you must know this of John in particular, who is
a man, which is the point you are labouring to establish; or, if you
do not know this of every individual man, and of John among the
rest, then you have no right to make such a sweeping general assertion,
which falls to the ground of itself. Either the premises are hasty or
false, and the conclusion rotten that way; or if they be sound, and
proved as matter-of-fact to the extent which is pretended, then you
have anticipated your conclusion, and your syllogism is pedantic and
superfluous. In fact, this form of the syllogism is an unmeaning play
upon words, or resolves itself into the merely probable or analogical
argument, that because all other men <em>have died</em>, John, who is one of
of them, <em>will die</em> also. The inference relating to historical truth, and
founded on the customary connection between cause and effect, is very
different from logical proof, or the impossibility of conceiving of
certain things otherwise than as inseparable. Suppose I see a row of
pillars before me, and that I chuse to affirm—‘Those hundred pillars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>are all of white marble; the pillar directly facing me is one of the
hundred; therefore that pillar is also of white marble’—would not
this be arrant trifling both with my own understanding and with that
of any one who had patience to hear me? But if I were to see a
number of pillars resembling each other in outward appearance, and
on examining all of them but one, found them of white marble and
concluded that that one was of white marble too, there would be
some common sense in this, but no logic. The mind, however, has
a natural bias to wrap up its conclusions (of whatever kind or degree)
in regular forms of words, and to deposit them in an imposing framework
of demonstration; it prefers the shadow of certainty to the
substance of truth and candour; and will not, if it can help it, leave
a single loop-hole for doubt to creep in at. Hence the tribe of
logicians, dogmatists, and verbal pretenders of all sorts.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE LATE MR. CURRAN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>April 26, 1829.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>This celebrated wit and orator in his latter days was a little in the
back-ground. He had lodgings at Brompton; and riding into town
one day, and hearing two gentlemen in the Park disputing about
Mathews’s Curran, he said—‘In faith, it’s the only Mr. Curran, that
is ever talked of now-a-days.’ He had some qualms about certain
peccadillos of his past life, and wanted to make confessors of his
friends. Certainly, a monastery is no unfit retreat for those who have
been led away by the thoughtless vivacity of youth, and wish to keep
up the excitement by turning the tables on themselves in age. The
crime and the remorse are merely the alternations of the same
passionate temperament. Mr. Curran had a flash of the eye, a
musical intonation of voice, such as we have never known excelled.
Mr. Mathews’s imitation of him, though it had been much admired,
does not come up to the original. Some of his bursts of forensic
eloquence deserve to be immortal, such as that appalling expression
applied to a hired spy and informer, that he ‘had been buried as a
man, and was dug up a witness.’ A person like this might find
language to describe the late <em>shots</em> at Edinburgh. Mr. Curran did
not shine so much in Parliament; but he sometimes succeeded
admirably in turning the laugh against his opponents. He compared
the situation of government after they had brought over a
member of Opposition to their side, and found the renegado of
no use to them, to the story of the country-gentleman who bought
Punch and complained of his turning out dull company. Some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Mr. Curran’s <em>bon-mots</em> and sallies of humour were first-rate. He sometimes
indulged in poetry, in which he did not excel. His taste in it
was but indifferent. He neither liked <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> nor <cite>Romeo and
Juliet</cite>. He had an ear for music, and both played and sung his native
ballads delightfully. He contended that the English had no national
music. He was an enthusiastic admirer of Mrs. Siddons. He said
of John Kemble, that, ‘he had an eye rather to <em>look at</em> than to <em>look
with</em>.’ His great passion was a love of English literature and the
society of literary men. He occasionally found his account in it.
Being one day in a group of philosophers, and the invention of fire
being spoken of, one of the party suggested that it was from seeing a
horse’s shoe strike fire; ‘and I suppose,’ said Curran triumphantly,
‘the horse-shoe was afterwards made with that fire.’</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE COURT JOURNAL—A DIALOGUE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>June 7, 1829.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'><em>M.</em>—Have you seen the <cite>Court Journal</cite>?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>G.</em>—No: I only read some ‘Maxims on Love,’ which I seemed
to have met with in some pre-existent work.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>M.</em>—Then you may tell C— from me it will not last three months.
People of fashion do not want to read accounts of themselves, written
by those who know nothing of the matter. This eternal babble about
high life is an affront to every one else, and an impertinence with
respect to those whom it is stupidly meant to flatter. What do those
care about tiresome descriptions of satin ottomans and ormolu carvings,
who are sick of seeing them from morning till night? No! they
would rather read an account of Donald Bean Lean’s Highland cave,
strewed with rushes, or a relation of a <em>row</em> in a night-cellar in St.
Giles’s. What they and all mankind want, is to vary the monotonous
round of their existence; to go out of themselves as much as possible;
and not to have their own oppressive and idle pretensions served up to
them again in a hash of mawkish affectation. They read <em>Cobbett</em>—it
is like an electrical shock to them, or a plunge in a cold-bath: it
braces while it jars their enervated fibres. He is a sturdy, blunt
yeoman: the other is a foppish footman, dressed up in cast-off finery.
Or if Lord L—— is delighted with a description (not well-done) of
his own house and furniture, do you suppose that Lord H——, who
is his rival in gewgaws and upholstery, will not be equally uneasy at
it? As to the vulgar, what they like is to see fine sights and not
to hear of them. They like to get inside a fine house, to see fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>things and touch them if they dare, and not to be tantalized with a
vapid inventory, which does not gratify their senses, and mortifies their
pride and sense of privation. The exaggerated admiration only makes
the exclusion more painful: it is like a staring sign to a show which
one has not money in one’s pocket to pay for seeing. Mere furniture
or private property can never be a subject to interest the public: the
possessor is entitled to the sole benefit of it. If there were an account
in the newspaper that all this finery was burnt to ashes, then all the
world would be eager to read it, saying all the time how sorry they
were, and what a shocking thing it was.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>G.</em>—Servants and country people always turn to the accidents and
offences in a newspaper.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>M.</em>—And their masters and mistresses too. Did you never read
the <em>Newgate Calendar</em>?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>G.</em>—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>M.</em>—Well, that is not <em>genteel</em>. This is what renders the <cite>Beggar’s
Opera</cite> so delightful; you despise the actors in the scene, and yet the
wit galls and brings down their <em>betters</em> from their airy flight with all
their borrowed plumage, so that we are put absolutely at our ease for
the time with respect to our own darling pretensions. G—— was
here the other evening; he said he thought the <cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite> came
after Shakspeare. I wonder who put that in his head; it was hardly
his own discovery.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>G.</em>—It seems neither Lord Byron nor Burke liked the <cite>Beggar’s
Opera</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>M.</em>—They were the losers by that opinion: but how do you
account for it?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>G.</em>—Lord Byron was a <em>radical</em> peer, Burke an upstart plebeian;
neither of them felt quite secure in the <em>niche</em> where they had stationed
themselves from the random-shots that were flying on the stage.
They could not say with <cite>Hamlet</cite>, ‘Our withers are unwrung.’ As to
Lord Byron, he might not relish the point of <em>Mrs. Peachum’s</em> speech,
‘Married a highwayman! Why, hussey, you will be as ill-treated
and as much neglected as if you had married a lord!’ Did you ever
hear the story of Miss ——, when she was quite a girl, going to see
Mrs. Siddons in the <em>Fatal Marriage</em>, and being taken out fainting into
the lobby, and calling out, ‘Oh <em>Biron, Biron</em>!’—‘Egad!’ said the
cool narrator of the story, ‘she has had enough of Byron since!’
With regard to Burke, there was a rotten core, a Serbonian bog in
his understanding, in which not only Gay’s masterpiece but the whole
of what modern literature, wit, and reason had done for the world,
sunk and was swallowed up in a fetid abyss for ever! But I am
sorry you think no better of the <cite>Court Journal</cite>. I was in hopes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>it might succeed, as a very old friend of mine has something to do
with it.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>M.</em>—Oh! but mischief must be put a stop to. This is the most
nauseous <em>toad-eating</em>, and it is as awkwardly done as it is ill-meant.
There is a fulsome pretence set up in one paper that rank consists in
birth and blood. It is at once to neutralise all the present race of
fashion. The civil wars of York and Lancaster put an end to almost
all the old nobility—there are none of the Plantagenets left now.
Those who go to court think themselves lucky if they can trace as
far back as the Nell Gwynns and Duchess of Clevelands in Charles
the Second’s days. Besides, all this prejudice about nobility and
ancestry should be understood and worshipped in silence and at a
distance, not thrown in the teeth of such people, as if they had
nothing else to boast of. They should be told of perfections which
they have not, as you praise a wit for her beauty and a fool for her
wit. Your friend should read <em>Count Grammont</em> to learn how to flatter
and cajole. Does not Mr. C—— know enough from experience of
the desire of lords and ladies to turn authors, and shine, not in a
ballroom, but on <em>his</em> counter?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>G.</em>—He expects the K—— to write; nay, it was with difficulty
he was dissuaded from offering a round sum.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>M.</em>—How much, pray?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>G.</em>—Five thousand guineas for half a page.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>M.</em>—It would not sell a single copy. People would think it was a
hoax and would not buy it. Those who believed it would not read
it. Oh! there is a letter of Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span> in a late number, on the
death of some lady he was attached to: it is prettily done, but it is
such good English, that I suspect it can hardly be a translation or an
original. If they could procure curious documents of this kind, and
had a magazine of the secrets, anecdotes, and correspondence of
people of high rank, undoubtedly it would answer; but this would be
another edition of the <em>Jockey Club</em>, and very different from its present
insipidity. Even children will not be crammed with honey.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>G.</em>—I understand there is to be no scandal. All the great are to
be supposed to be elegantly good, and to wear virtue with a grace
peculiar to people of fashion.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>M.</em>—That will at any rate be new. And then I see there are
criticisms on pictures: the writer is thrown into raptures with the
portraits of Lord and Lady Castlereagh. And this is followed by a
drawling, pitiable account of two little Corregios, as if they were
miracles and had descended from heaven—the ‘Madonna’ and ‘Mercury
teaching Cupid to read.’ They are well enough, though Sir
Joshua has done the same thing better. But higher praise could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>be lavished on the ‘St. Jerome’ or the ‘Night at Dresden,’ or the
‘Ceiling at Parma,’ which is his best, though it has fallen into
decay.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>G.</em>—Collectors think one Corregio just as good as another; and it
is to meet this feeling, probably, that the article is written.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE LATE DR. PRIESTLEY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>June 14, 1829.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>The epithet of <em>the late</em> could not be applied to this celebrated
character in the sense in which it has been turned upon some <em>late</em>
wits and dinner-hunters as never being in time; if he had a fault, it
was that of being precipitate and premature, of sitting down to the
banquet which he had prepared for others before it was half-done; of
seeing things with too quick and hasty a glance, of finding them in
embryo, and leaving them too often in an unfinished state. This
turn of his intellect had to do with his natural temper—he was
impatient, somewhat peevish and irritable in little things, though not
from violence or acerbity, but from seeing what was proper to be
done quicker than others, and not liking to wait for an absurdity.
On great and trying occasions, he was calm and resigned, having
been schooled by the lessons of religion and philosophy, or, perhaps,
from being, as it were, taken by surprise, and never having been
accustomed to the indulgence of strong passions or violent emotions.
His frame was light, fragile, neither strong nor elegant; and in going
to any place, he walked on before his wife (who was a tall, powerful
woman) with a primitive simplicity, or as if a certain restlessness and
hurry impelled him on with a projectile force before others. His
personal appearance was altogether singular and characteristic. It
belonged to the class which may be called <em>scholastic</em>. His feet
seemed to have been entangled in a gown, his features to have
been set in a wig or taken out of a mould. There was nothing to
induce you to say with the poet, that ‘his body thought’; it was
merely the envelop of his mind. In his face there was a strange
mixture of acuteness and obtuseness; the nose was sharp and turned
up, yet rounded at the end, a keen glance, a quivering lip, yet the
aspect placid and indifferent, without any of that expression which
arises either from the close workings of the passions or an intercourse
with the world. You discovered the prim, formal look of the
Dissenter—none of the haughtiness of the churchman nor the wildness
of the visionary. He was, in fact, always the student in his
closet, moved in or out, as it happened, with no perceptible variation:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>he sat at his breakfast with a folio volume before him on one side and
a note-book on the other; and if a question were asked him, answered
it like an absent man. He stammered, spoke thick, and huddled his
words ungracefully together. To him the whole business of life
consisted in <em>reading and writing</em>; and the ordinary concerns of this
world were considered as a frivolous or mechanical interruption to
the more important interests of science and of a future state. Dr.
<span class='sc'>Priestley</span> might, in external appearance, have passed for a French
priest, or the lay-brother of a convent: in literature, he was the
Voltaire of the Unitarians. He did not, like Mr. Southey, to be
sure (who has been denominated the English Voltaire,) vary from
prose to poetry, or from one side of a question to another; but he
took in a vast range of subjects of very opposite characters, treated
them all with the same acuteness, spirit, facility, and perspicuity, and
notwithstanding the intricacy and novelty of many of his speculations,
it may be safely asserted that there is not an obscure sentence in all
he wrote. <em>Those who run may read.</em> He wrote on history, grammar,
law, politics, divinity, metaphysics, and natural philosophy—and those
who perused his works fancied themselves entirely, and were in a
great measure, masters of all these subjects. He was one of the
very few who could make abstruse questions popular; and in this
respect he was on a par with Paley with twenty times his discursiveness
and subtlety. Paley’s loose casuistry, which is his strong-hold
and chief attraction, he got (every word of it) from Abraham
Tucker’s <em>Light of Nature</em>. A man may write fluently on a number
of topics with the same pen, and that pen a very blunt one; but this
was not Dr. Priestley’s case; the studies to which he devoted himself
with so much success and <em>eclat</em> required different and almost incompatible
faculties. What for instance can be more distinct or more
rarely combined than metaphysical refinement and a talent for experimental
philosophy? The one picks up the grains, the other spins
the threads of thought. Yet Dr. Priestley was certainly the best
controversialist of his day, and one of the best in the language; and
his chemical experiments (so curious a variety in a dissenting minister’s
pursuits) laid the foundation and often nearly completed the superstructure
of most of the modern discoveries in that science. This is
candidly and gratefully acknowledged by the French chemists,
however the <em>odium theologicum</em> may slur over the obligation in this
country, or certain fashionable lecturers may avoid the repetition of
startling names. Priestley’s <em>Controversy with Dr. Price</em> is a masterpiece
not only of ingenuity, vigour, and logical clearness, but of verbal
dexterity and artful evasion of difficulties, if any one need a model of
this kind. His antagonist stood no chance with him in ‘the dazzling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>fence of argument,’ and yet Dr. Price was no mean man. We
should like to have seen a tilting-bout on some point of scholastic
divinity between the little Presbyterian parson and the great Goliath
of modern Calvinism, Mr. Irving; he would have had his huge
Caledonian boar-spear, his Patagonian club out of his hands in a
twinkling with his sharp Unitarian foil. The blear-eyed demon of
vulgar dogmatism and intolerance would have taken his revenge by
gnashing his teeth, rolling his eyes in a resistless phrenzy, and
denouncing as out of the pale of Christian charity a man who placed
his chief comfort in this life in his hope of the next, and who would
have walked firmly and cheerfully to a stake in the fulness of his
belief of the Christian revelation. Out upon these pulpit demigorgons,
‘Anthropagi and men who eat each other,’ to gratify the canine
malice and inward gnawing of their morbid understandings, and
worse than the infuriated savage, not contented to kill the body,
would ‘cast both body and soul into hell;’ and unless they can see
from their crazy thrones of spiritual pride and mountebank effrontery,
the whole world cowering like one outstretched congregation in a
level sea of bare heads and upturned wondering looks at their feet,
prone and passive, and aghast under the thunders of their voice, the
flashes of their eye—would snatch Heaven’s own bolt to convert the
solid globe into a sea of fire to torture millions of their fellow-creatures
in for the slightest difference of opinion from them, or dissent from
the authority of a poor, writhing, agonised reptile, who works himself
up in imagination by raving and blasphemy into a sort of fourth
person in the Trinity, and would avenge his mortified ambition, his
moonstruck-madness, and ebbing popularity as the wrongs of the <span class='sc'>Most
High</span>!—‘Nay, an you mouth, we’ll rant as well as you!’—To
return to Dr. Priestley and common sense, if it be possible to get
down these from the height of <em>melo-dramatic</em> and apocalyptic orthodoxy.
We do not place the subject of this notice in the first class of metaphysical
reasoners either for originality or candour: but in boldness
of inquiry, quickness, and elasticity of mind, and ease in making
himself understood, he had no superior. He had wit too, though
this was a resource to which he resorted only in extreme cases.
Mr. Coleridge once threw a respectable dissenting congregation into
an unwonted forgetfulness of their gravity, by reciting a description,
from the pen of the transatlantic fugitive, of the manner in which the
first man might set about making himself, according to the doctrine
of the Atheists. Mr. Coleridge put no marks of quotation either
before or after the passage, which was extremely grotesque and
ludicrous; but imbibed the whole of the applause it met with in his
flickering smiles and oily countenance. Dr. Priestley’s latter years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>were unhappily embittered by his unavailing appeals to the French
philosophers in behalf of the Christian religion; and also by domestic
misfortunes, to which none but a Cobbett could have alluded in terms
of triumph. We see no end to the rascality of human nature; all
that there is good in it is the constant butt of the base and brutal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>SECTS AND PARTIES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>August 2, 1829.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>We from our souls sincerely hate all cabals and <em>coteries</em>; and this is
our chief objection to sects and parties. People who set up to judge
for themselves on every question that comes before them, and quarrel
with received opinions and established usages, find so little sympathy
from the rest of the world that they are glad to get any one to agree
with them, and with that proviso the poorest creature becomes their
<em>Magnus Apollo</em>. The mind sets out indeed in search of truth and on
a principle of independent inquiry; but is so little able to do without
leaning on someone else for encouragement and support, that we
presently see those who have separated themselves from the mere
mob, and the great masses of prejudice and opinion, forming into
little groups of their own and appealing to one another’s approbation,
as if they had secured a monopoly of common sense and reason.
Wherever two or three of this sort are gathered together, there is
self-conceit in the midst of them. ‘You grant me judgment, and I
grant you wit’—is the key-note from which an admirable duett, trio,
or quartett of the understanding may be struck up at any time to the
entire satisfaction of the parties concerned, though the bye-standers
may be laughing at or execrating the unwelcome discord. The
principle of all reform is this, that there is a tendency to dogmatism,
to credulity and intolerance in the human mind itself, as well as in
certain systems of bigotry or superstition; and until reformers are
themselves aware of, and guard carefully against, the natural infirmity
which besets them in common with all others, they must necessarily
run into the error which they cry out against. Without this self-knowledge
and circumspection, though the great wheel of vulgar
prejudice and traditional authority may be stopped or slackened in its
course, we shall only have a number of small ones of petulance, contradiction,
and partisanship set a-going to our frequent and daily
annoyance in its place: or (to vary the figure) instead of crowding
into a common stage-coach or hum-drum vehicle of opinion to arrive
at a conclusion, every man will be for mounting his own <em>velocipede</em>,
run up against his neighbours, and exhaust his breath and agitate his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>limbs in vain. In Mr. Bentham’s <em>Book of Fallacies</em> we apprehend
are not to be found the crying sins of singularity, rash judgment, and
self-applause. What boots it, we might ask, to get rid of tests and
subscription to thirty-nine articles of orthodox belief, if, in lieu of
this wholesale and comprehensive mode of exercising authority over
our fellows, a <span class='sc'>Dogma</span> is placed upon the table at breakfast time, sits
down with us to dinner, or is laid on our pillow at night, rigidly
prescribing what we are to eat, drink, and how many hours we are to
sleep? Or be it that the authority of Aristotle and the schoolmen is
gone by, what shall the humble and serious inquirer after truth profit
by it, if he still cannot say that his soul is his own for the sublime
dulness of Mr. Maculloch, and the Dunciad of political economists?
The imprimatur of the Star Chamber, the <em>cum privilegio regis</em> is taken
off from printed books—what does the freedom of the press or
liberality of sentiment gain, if a board of <em>Utility</em> at Charing Cross must
affix its stamp, before a jest can find its way into a newspaper, or
must knock a flower of speech on the head with the sledge-hammer
of cynical reform? The cloven-foot, the overweening, impatient,
exclusive spirit breaks out in different ways, in different times and
circumstances. While men are quite ignorant and in the dark, they
trust to others, and force you to do so under pain of fire and faggot:—when
they have learned a little they think they know every thing,
and would compel you to conform to that opinion, under pain of their
impertinence, maledictions, and sarcasms, which are the modern rack
and thumb-screw. The mode of torture, it must be confessed, is
refined, though the intention is the same. Their ill-temper and want
of toleration fall the hardest on their own side, for those who adhere
to fashion and power care no more about their good or ill word, than
about the short, unmelodious gruntings of any other sordid stye.
But how is any poor devil who has got into their clutches to shelter
himself from their malevolence and party-spite? Why, by enlisting
under their banners, swearing to all that they say, and going all
lengths with them. Otherwise, he is a <em>black sheep</em> in the flock, and
made a butt of by the rest. This is a self-evident process. For the
fewer people any sect or party have to sympathise with them, the
more entire must that sympathy be: it must be without flaw or
blemish, as a set-off to the numbers on the other side; and they who
set up to be wiser than all the world put together, cannot afford to
acknowledge themselves wrong in any particular. You must, therefore,
agree to all their sense or nonsense, allow them to be judges
equally of what they do or do not understand, adopt their cant, repeat
their jargon, have no notions but what they have, caricature their
absurdities, make yourself obnoxious for their satisfaction, and a slave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>and lacquey to their opinions, humours, and convenience; or they
black-ball you, send you to Coventry, and play the devil with you.
Thus, for any writer in a highly enlightened and liberal morning
paper, not merely to question the grand arcanum of population or the
doctrine of rent, would be both great and petty treason; but it would
be as much as his <em>place</em> was worth, to suggest a hint that Mrs. Chatterley
is not a fine woman and a charming actress. Fanatics and
innovators formerly appealed in support of their dreams and extravagancies
to inspiration and an inward light; the modern race of
philosophical projectors, not having this resource, are obliged to
fortify themselves in a double crust of confidence in themselves, and
contempt for their predecessors and contemporaries. It is easy to
suppose what a very repulsive sort of people they must be! Indeed,
to remedy what was thought a hard exterior and an intolerable air of
assumption on the part of the professors of the new school, a machine,
it is said, has been completed in Mr. Bentham’s garden in Westminster,
which turns out a very useful invention of jurisprudence, morals, logic,
political economy, constitutions, and codifications, as infallibly and
with as little variation as a barrel-organ plays ‘God save the King,’
or ‘Rule Britannia’:—nay, so well does it work and so little trouble
or attendance does it require from the adepts, that the latter mean to
sign a truce with gravity and ‘wise saws,’ some of them having
entered at the bar, others being about to take orders in the church,
others having got places in the India-house, and all being disposed to
let the Bentham-machine shift for itself! <i><span lang="la">Omne tulit punctum qui
miscuit utile dulci</span></i>:—Mr. Bentham is old, and doubtless has made his
will! Reformers will hardly see themselves in religious schismatics
and sectarians, whom they despise. Perhaps others may be struck
with the likeness. <em>Rational dissenters</em>, for example, think, because
they alone profess the title, they alone possess the thing. All rational
dissenters are with them wise and good. An Unitarian is another
name for sense and honesty; and must it not be so, when to those of
an opposite faith it is a name of enmity and reproach? But the
intolerance on one side, though it accounts for, does not disprove the
weakness on the other. We have heard of devotees who employ a
<em>serious</em> baker, a <em>serious</em> tailor, a <em>serious</em> cobbler, etc. So there are
staunch reformists who would prefer a <em>radical</em> compositor, a <em>radical</em>
stationer or bookbinder, to all others; and think little of those on
their side of the question who, besides adhering to a principle, have
not, in their over-zeal and contempt for their adversaries, contrived to
render it offensive or ridiculous. A sound practical consistency does
not satisfy the wilful restlessness of the advocates of change. They
must have the piquancy of startling paradoxes, the pruriency of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>romantic and ticklish situations, the pomp of itinerant professors of
patriotism and <em>placarders</em> of their own <em>lives</em>, <em>travels</em>, and <em>opinions</em>.
Why must a man stand up in a three-cornered hat and canonicals to
bear testimony against the Christian religion, and in favour of reform?
We hate all such impertinent masquerading and <em>double entendre</em>.
Those who are accustomed to judge for themselves, and express their
convictions at some risk and loss, are too apt to come from thinking
that opinions may be right, <em>though</em> they are singular, to conclude that
they are right, <em>because</em> they are singular. The more they differ from
the world, the more convinced they are, because it flatters their self-love;
and they are only quite satisfied and at their ease when they
shock and disgust every one around them. They no longer consider
the connexion between the conclusion and the premises, but between
any idle hypothesis and their personal vanity. They cling obstinately
to opinions, as they have been hastily formed; and patronize every
whim that they fancy is their own. They are most confident of
‘what they are least assured;’ and will stake all they are worth on
the <em>forlorn hope</em> of their own imaginary sagacity and clearness. An
<em>idiosyncrasy</em> steals into every thing; <em>their</em> way is best. Always
regarding the world at large as an old dotard, they think any single
individual in it quite beneath their notice—unless it is an <i><span lang="la">alter idem</span></i> of
the select <em>coterie</em>—neither consult you about their affairs, nor deign
you an answer on your own, and have a model of perfection in their
minds to which they refer all public and private transactions. There
are <em>methodists</em> in business as well as in religion, who have a peculiar
happy knack in folding a letter, or in saying <em>How d’ye do</em>, who
postpone the main object to some pragmatical theory or foppish
punctilio, and who might take for their motto—<em>all for conceit or the
world well lost</em>.</p>

enough even for the task he undertook. An instance occurred the
other day. A servant-girl had been decoyed from her situation, and
on complaint being made before the magistrate, the officers traced
her to Duke’s-place, and brought her back to her friends in Wardour-Street.
She was dressed up quite in the height of the fashion; and
every one that went to see her, came away astonished at her perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>beauty. Could Hogarth have painted this? Yet here was a scene
quite in his way. He selects what is bad in St. Giles’s, not what is
best in nature. That old Mother W—— lives for ever. It was
she who decoyed away Emily Coventry that sat to Sir Joshua for his

<p class='c007'><em>J.</em>—Fielding has tried to describe <em>Sophia</em> as a beauty, but makes
a wretched hand of it. He says first she was a beauty; and then to
let you know what sort of a beauty she was, that she was like the
<em>Venus of Medici</em>; then that her nose inclined to be Roman, which
the <em>Venus de Medici’s</em> does not; then that she resembled Kneller’s
portrait of Lady Ranelagh, which is like neither. The truth is, he
did not know what she was like; nor that he could not in words give
a description of beauty, which is the painter’s province.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>T.</em>—Coleridge used to remark that description was the vice of
poetry, and allegory of painting.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>J.</em>—Nothing can be better said. Since you told me that remark
of his about <em>Paul and Virginia</em>, he has risen vastly in my estimation.
Again, why does the correspondent in the Atlas take me up short for
saying that ‘we laugh at a person who is rolled in the gutter?’ He
observes on this, ‘if it is an accident, the laughter is silly, and not a
case in point; if inflicted as a punishment for some petty injustice,
we do not laugh, but rub our hands.’ So that we are to laugh in
neither case. Is the ridicule merited where the cobbler, in the
‘Election Dinner,’ has smutted the face of his next neighbour? Or
does the cobbler laugh the less, or will he not laugh on for ever, on
this account? Has not Hogarth immortalised this piece of silliness
in this disgraceful scene? Who will set limits (by the author’s
<em>crambo</em>) to the length to which he lolls out his tongue, or to the
portentous rolling of his eyes in a squint of ecstasy? Is the sly leer
and drooping of the widow’s eyelids, or the position of the parson’s
hands in the ‘Harlot’s Funeral,’ drawing as well as character and
invention? Or is the fighting of the dog and the man for the bone
on a perfect footing of equality (to show that hunger levels all distinctions),
or the mother letting the child fall over the wall in the ‘Gin-lane,’
or the girl in the ‘Noon,’ ‘with her pie-dish tottering like her
virtue, and the contents running over,’ (as I have seen it somewhere
expressed,) an example of skill in drawing? It is easy to paint a
face without a nose, or with a wry one; the difficulty is to make it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>straight. Few persons can draw a circle; any one may draw a
crooked line.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>T.</em>—But has not Hogarth hit off the exact character and expression;
and is not that a proof of the painter’s hand and eye?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>J.</em>—It may be so; but you cannot be sure of it. The correspondent
of the paper laughs at the idea of Hogarth’s coming under the
article of writing. He <em>has</em> come under the article of writing. Does
not the critic speak of his ‘immortal tales?’ Does Mr. Lamb
expatiate on the drawing, colour, and effects of light and shade, or
only on the moral and story? He has left out one half of the
language of painting in the prints; and they are the better for it. Nor
do I see what objection there is to the comparison of Hogarth to
buffoons on the stage. For my part, I think Liston comes much
nearer to Hogarth than Emery’s <em>Tyke</em>; and I am sure his <em>Lord
Grizzle</em> is just as good <em>in its way</em> as anything can possibly be. Why
then does the critic scout the comparison? Because it would be
ridiculous to say, that Liston’s <em>Lord Grizzle</em> is as fine as Mrs. Siddons’s
<em>Lady Macbeth</em>; that both fulfilled their parts equally, and that neither
could do more without infringing on the integrity of their characters.
Yet if the dignity of the subject is to be left out of the question,
Liston may be put into the scale with Mrs. Siddons just as well as
Emery; but if not, then neither one nor the other can. Any one
for me may say he likes <em>Punch and the puppet-show</em> as well as the
finest tragedy—I should think it honest and natural enough—but I
hate putting up at a half-way house between farce and tragedy, and
pretending that there is no difference in the case. Persons who have
no taste for, but an aversion to whatever is great and elevated, are
ashamed openly to patronise farce, lest they should be laughed at;
and they, therefore, get something intermediate between that and
tragedy, and set it up as the finest thing in the world, to escape
ridicule and satisfy their own perverse inclination. It is necessary to
set one’s face against such vulgar critics; for, like other vulgar people,
if you do not keep them quite out, they will constantly encroach and
turn you out of your most settled convictions with their mongrel
theories.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>T.</em>—What is the aim of all high tragedy? It is to resolve the
sense of pain or suffering into the sense of <em>power</em> by the aid of imagination,
and by grandeur of conception and character. What is the
object of Hogarth’s tragicomedy? To reverse this order: that is, he
gives us the extremest distress in the most revolting circumstances
and in connection with the most unfeeling and weakest characters, so
as either to produce the utmost disgust or excite as little sympathy as
possible. Why must maternal affection be displayed, and, as it were,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>outraged in the strength of attachment to a most brutish and worthless
moon-calf of a son? The moral may be strictly true, but the mode
of conveying it is no less a penance. Why must the feeling of love
be exemplified in the persevering attachment of the victim of seduction
to her profligate and contemptible seducer? This is essential to
Hogarth’s conception of passion, that it should be at variance with its
object, incongruous, and bordering on the absurd and ludicrous.
Why must a fine feeling or sentiment be dragged through the kennel
or stuck in the pillory before it can be tolerated in his graphic
designs? There is neither unity nor grandeur. Mr. Lamb admires
the expression of the losing gamester in the ‘Rake’s Progress:’ it is
exactly what Liston would give in attempting such a part, and not
unlike him. Why show the extreme of passion in faces unsusceptible
of it, or kill the sympathy by the meanness and poverty of the associations?
Mr. Lamb despises Kean’s face in <cite>Othello</cite>: I prefer it to
any of Hogarth’s tragic faces, which are generally of the mock-heroic
class.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c008'><sup>[59]</sup></a> The Methodist preacher in the cart with the <em>Idle Apprentice</em>
is another <em>Mawworm</em>, a fantastic figure, tossed about by the wind or
the spirit, though the conception would be fine for a novel or <em>written</em>
story: the apprentice himself is a scare-crow, the sport of the mob,
with whose indifference you take part, not with the sufferings of the
hero, if he is supposed to have any. The whole is a game at tragic
cross-purposes. The sublimity (such as it is) rests on a foundation
of the squalid and scurrilous. The incongruous was Hogarth’s
element, and he could not get out of his own or (what is I fear)
the national character, which delights in laughing at and exulting
over the defects and mishaps of others, not from any concern for
them, but as a foil to its own discontented humour and conscious
want of higher resources. Defoe, who was in the same age and
class, had more imagination. His <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> is in perfect
keeping. He is not solitary, but solitude: from being shut out from
the world, he fills the universe with himself, and his being expands
to the circumference of the ocean and sky. Hogarth would have
shut him up in a workhouse or a gaol, with boys hooting at him
through the bars, and no escape left on the wings of the imagination
or the strength of will. This may be very intense, but it is not to my
taste. A disciple of this school should not go to see Madame <em>Pasta</em>
act. He would like Madame <em>Pesaroni</em> better, for she is ugly, squat,
and her voice is masculine and loud. The other, who is all harmony,
would oppress and make him uneasy for want of some salvo to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>self-love. Would a critic of this order like to see a tragic actress
with a wooden leg? For this is Hogarth. Mr. Lamb admires
<cite>Moll Flanders</cite>; would he marry <cite>Moll Flanders</cite>? There ought to
be something in common in our regard for the original and the copy.
A taste for the odd and eccentric eats like a canker into the mind;
and if not checked, drives out all relish for the noble and consistent
as stiff and pedantic. The drollery is certainly less; and if there is
not some set-off in earnestness and dignity, the serious must be at a
low ebb indeed, and <cite>Hudibras</cite> is finer than <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>. It would
be a proof of bad taste to like to look at a mean or ill-formed face, for
the sake of laughing at it, rather than at a fine one. And so in art:
the representation of brutality, coarseness, and want of capacity and
feeling is surely less desirable than the representation of the opposite
qualities; or it is saying that you laugh at and despise a thing for
falling short of a certain excellence and perfection, and when it gains
that excellence and perfection, it is no better than it was before.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>J.</em>—You remember the drawing I showed you by Lane, after the
‘Possessed Boy’ of Domenichino? There was there infinite sensibility,
infinite delicacy, agony with sweetness, beauty in the midst of
distortion. You saw there that every fine feeling had passed through
the painter’s mind, or he could not have expressed them; you were
made to sympathise with them, and to understand and revere them as
a part of your own nature. Compared with works like this, which are
the pure mirrors of truth and beauty, Hogarth’s subjects are the very
‘measles’ of art—the scum and offal—it is like going on a voyage in a
convict-ship, with an alternation of the same humours and the same
horrors—it is a bad prospect for life.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>T.</em>—There is some limit. The late Edinburgh murders would not
bear being transferred to the canvass, though the group at Ambrose’s
would make a subject for a sketch, so nice are the distinctions of
taste.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>J.</em>—The comic sets off the serious by contrast, and is a necessary
relief; but how little a way does the sense of defect go towards a
conception of, or power to embody the reverse! Look at Hogarth’s
attempts at dignified subjects, and see how poor and feeble they are.
His ‘Pool of Bethesda’ is pitiable; but in the burlesque composition,
where he introduces the devil cutting away the leg of the stool on
which St. Paul is preaching, he is himself again, and worthy of all
imitation. The critic in the Atlas asks what I mean by originality,
as if I thought it independent of any prototypes in nature? No,
originality consists in seeing nature for yourself; but it does not
follow that everyone can do this or is to see nature alike, or there
would be nothing remarkable in it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span><em>T.</em>—Crabbe is an original writer; but it is to be hoped he will
have few followers. Mr. Lamb, by softening the disagreeableness of
one of his tales, has taken out the sting.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>J.</em>—Hogarth is an exception to general rules; I said so before.
He is the only great comic painter; and he is so for this reason—that
painting is not the mother-tongue of comedy. Would not this
be allowed of sculpture? I have not seen the ‘Tam O’Shanter’; but
some Scotch critics are already, I hear, for exploding the <em>antique</em>.
Painting is a dry, plodding art; a bottle-nose, if you come to examine
it closely, becomes a very dull affair. We <em>talk</em> of a hump-back or a
sore leg, which is enough of a good thing; the painter is obliged to
give them entire, which is too much. Neither can he carry off this
grossness by brilliancy of illustration, or rapidity of narrative. The
eye and the mind take in a group or a succession of incidents in an
instant; the hand follows lamely and slowly after, and naturally loses,
in the mechanical details of each object, the surprise, odd starts, and
contrasts, which are the life of comedy. Hogarth alone, by his
double allusions, and by his giving motion (which is time) overcame
this difficulty, or painted as if he were no painter, but set down each
figure by a stroke of the pencil, or in a kind of <em>short-hand</em> of the art,
being obliged to run neither into caricature nor still-life. This
extreme facility or tenaciousness (amounting to a two-fold language)
was his peculiar <em>forte</em>, and that in which he was, and will remain, unrivalled.
Ducrow acts romances on horseback; but it is not the
best way of acting them; and few will imitate him without breaking
their necks.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>T.</em>—Do not the same remarks apply in some measure to painting
history?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>J.</em>—In some measure, they do; and therefore grand and dignified
subjects are in general to be preferred to the more violent and distressing
ones. Therefore Titian’s portraits are on a par with history.
You who admire Titian, how you must look at Hogarth! You see
they avoid the sight of blood even on the stage. In short, it is a
question, whether low and disagreeable subjects are fit to be painted;
and Sir Joshua, among others, did not much approve of them. It is
<em>not</em> a question whether grace and grandeur are fit subjects for painting—this
alone settles the preference, and is some excuse for the author
of the <cite>Discourses</cite> in perhaps making it a little too exclusive. If it were
true that Hogarth is universal, or contains the highest kind of excellence,
no one would dispute about him. After all, a <em>hurdygurdy</em>
is neither a lute nor an organ.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CONVERSATIONS AS GOOD AS REAL (2)</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>November 1, 1829.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'><em>T.</em>—Was I not right in stating it to be an error to suppose that
character is one thing, and to be judged of from a single circumstance?
The simplicity of language constantly runs us into false
abstractions. We call a man by one name, and forget the heap of
contradictions of which he is composed. An acquaintance was wondering
not long ago, how a man of sense that he mentioned could be
guilty of such absurdities in practice. I answered that a man’s
understanding often had no more influence over his will than if they
belonged to two different persons; nor frequently so much, since we
sometimes consented to be governed by advice, though we could not
controul our passions if left to ourselves.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>J.</em>—That is very true; but I do not see why you should express
so much eagerness about it, as if your life depended on it.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>T.</em>—Nor I neither: I was not aware that I did so.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>J.</em>—You lay too much stress on these speculative opinions and
abstruse distinctions. You fancy it is the love of truth: it is quite as
much the pride of understanding. Are you as ready to be convinced
yourself as you are bent on convincing others? You and those like
you pretend to benefit mankind by discovering something new; but
you can find out nothing that has not been invented and forgotten a
hundred times. The world turns round just the same, in spite of the
chirping of all the grasshoppers or squabbles of all the philosophers
upon it. I told G. so the other day, who did not much like it—I
said he gave a power of <em>creation</em> to the human mind, which did
not belong to it. Even Shakspeare, who was so original and saw
so deeply into the springs of nature, created nothing: he only
brought forward what existed before. I said, ‘You may observe and
combine, but you can add nothing—neither a colour to the rainbow,
nor a note to music, nor a faculty to the mind. And it’s well that
you cannot; for my belief is, that if you could create the smallest
thing, the world would not last three months, so little are you to
be trusted with power.’ G. retorted by a charge of misanthropy;
and I asked him who were those dignifiers of the species to whom
he wished me to look up with so much awe and reverence. He
answered, somewhat to my surprise, Burke, Fox, and Sheridan. I
expected he would have named Lord Bacon, or some of those. I
was not much staggered by his authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>T.</em>—I did not know G. was so parliamentary: he might, while
he was about it, have mentioned the three last speakers of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>House of Commons, Lord Colchester, Lord Sidmouth, and Mr.
Onslow.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>J.</em>—He should have gone farther off: it is distance that hides
defects and magnifies. So it is with that prejudice of classical learning.
You lock up names in an obsolete language, and they become
sacred. I do not wish to speak against a classical education; it
refines and softens, I grant; and I see the want of it in Cobbett,
and others, who may be regarded as upstarts in letters. But surely
it often gives a false estimate of men and things. Every one brought
up in colleges, and drugged with Latin and Greek for a number of
years, firmly believes <em>that there have been about five people in the world,
and that they are dead</em>. All that actually exists, he holds to be
nothing. The world about him is a phantasmagoria: he considers
it a personal affront that any one should have common sense, or be able
to find his way along the street, without looking for it in Plato or
Aristotle. The classical standard turns shadows into realities and
realities into shadows. A man of sense is trying to get the better of
this early prejudice all his life; and hardly succeeds, after infinite
mortification, at last. The dunces and pedants are the best off;
they never suspect that there is any wisdom in the world but that of
the ancients, of which they are the depositaries.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>T.</em>—I do not think G. goes that length; but he only exists in
his passion for books and for literary fame. You cannot shock him
more than by questioning any established reputation.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>J.</em>—Yes, he conceives himself to be a free-thinker, and yet is a
bigot in his way.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>T.</em>—Men will have some idol, some mythology of their own—the
<em>dii majores</em> or <em>minores</em>—something that they think greater than themselves,
or that they would wish to resemble; and G. would be
as angry at a sceptic on the subject of Burke’s style, as a Catholic
would be at a heretic who denied the virtues and miracles of his
patron saint.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>September 27 and October 4, 1829.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>I. There is no flattery so gross or extravagant but it will be acceptable.
It leaves some sting of pleasure behind, since its very excess
seems to imply that there must be some foundation for it. Tell the
ugliest person in the world that he is the handsomest, the greatest fool
that he is a wit, and he will believe and thank you. There is a
possibility at least that you may be sincere. Even the sycophant’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>ironical laugh turns to a smile of self-complacency at our own fancied
perfections.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. There is no abuse so foul or unprovoked but some part of it
will <em>stick</em>. Ill words break the charm of good deeds. Call a man
names all the year round, and at the end of the year (for no other
reason) his best friends will not care to mention his name. It is no
pleasant reflection that a man has been accused, however unjustly, of
a folly or a crime. We involuntarily associate words with things;
and the imagination retains an unfavourable impression long after the
understanding is disabused. Or if we repel the charge and resent
the injustice, this is making a toil of a pleasure, and our cowardice
and indolence soon take part with the malice of mankind. The
assailants are always the more courageous party. It degrades a man
even to be subjected to undeserved reproach, for it seems as if without
some flaw or blemish no one would dare to attack him; so that
the viler and more unprincipled the abuse, the lower it sinks, not him
who offers, but him who is the object of it, in general estimation. If
we see a man covered with mud we avoid him without expressing
the cause. The favourites of the public, like Cæsar’s wife, must not
be suspected; and it is enough if we admire and bear witness to the
superiority of another under the most favourable circumstances—to
do this in spite of secret calumny and vulgar clamour is a pitch of
generosity which the world has not arrived at.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. A certain <em>manner</em> makes more conquests than either wit or
beauty. Suppose a woman to have a graceful ease of deportment, and
a mild self-possession pervading every look and tone of voice; this
exercises an immediate influence on a person of an opposite and
irritable temperament—it calms and enchants him at once. It is like
soft music entering the room—from that time he can only breathe in
her presence, and to be torn from her is to be torn from himself for
ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>IV. Fame and popularity are <em>disparate</em> quantities, having no
common measure. A poet or painter now living may be as great as
any poet or painter that ever did live; and if he be so, he will be so
thought of by future ages, but he cannot by the present. Persons of
overweening vanity and short-sighted ambition, who would forestall
the meed of fame, show themselves unworthy of it, for they reduce it
to a level with the reputation they have already earned. They
should surely leave something to look forward to. It is weighing
dross against gold—comparing a meteor with the polar star. Lord
Byron’s narrowness or presumption in this respect was remarkable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>What! did he not hope to live two hundred years himself, that he
should say it was merely a fashion to admire Milton and Shakspeare
as it was the fashion to admire him? Those who compare Sir
Walter Scott with Shakspeare do not know what they are doing.
They may blunt the feeling with which we regard Shakspeare as an
old and tried friend, though they cannot transfer it to Sir Walter
Scott, who is, after all, but a new and dazzling acquaintance. To
argue that there is no difference in the circumstances is not to put the
author of ‘Waverley’ into actual possession of the reversion of fame,
but to say that he shall never enjoy it, since it is no better than a
chimera and an illusion. It is striking at the foundation of true and
lasting renown, and overturning with impatient and thoughtless hands
the proud pre-eminence, the golden seats and blest abodes which the
predestined heirs of immortality wait for beyond the tomb. The
living are merely candidates (more or less successful) for popular
applause, the <em>dead</em> are a religion, or they are nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>V. Persons who tell an artist that he is equal to Claude, or a
writer that he is as great as Bacon, do not add to the satisfaction
of their hearers, but pay themselves a left-handed compliment, by
supposing that their judgment is equivalent to the suffrage of posterity.</p>

<p class='c007'>VI. A French artist advised young beginners against being too
fond of a variety of colours, which might do very well on a smaller
scale, but when they came to paint a large picture they would find
they had soon lavished all their resources. So superficial writers
may deck out their barren round of <em>common-places</em> in the finest phrases
imaginable; but those who are accustomed to <em>work out</em> a subject by
dint of study, must not use up their whole stock of eloquence at once,
they must bring forward their most appropriate expressions as they
approach nearer to the truth, and raise their style with their thoughts.
A good general keeps his reserve, the <em>élite</em> of his troops, to charge at
the critical moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>VII. ‘Procrastination is the thief of time.’ It is singular that we
are so often loth to begin what gives us great satisfaction in the
progress, and what, after we have once begun it, we are as loth to
leave off. The reason is, that the imagination is not excited till the
first step is taken or the first blow is struck. Before we begin a
certain task, we have little notion how we shall set about it, or how
we shall proceed: it is like attempting something of which we have
no knowledge, and which we feel we are incapable of doing. It is
no wonder, therefore, that a strong repugnance accompanies this
seeming inaptitude: it is having to <em>make bricks without straw</em>. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>after the first effort is over, and we have turned our minds to the
subject, one thing suggests another, our ideas pour in faster than we
can use them, and we launch into the stream which bears us on with
ease and pleasure to ourselves. The painter who did not like to mix
his colours or begin on a new canvas in the morning, sees the light
close in upon him with unwilling eyes; and the essayist, though
gravelled for a thought, or at a loss for words at the outset of his
labours, winds up with alacrity and spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>VIII. Conversation is like a game at tennis, or any other game of
skill. A person shines in one company who makes no figure in
another—just as a tolerably good cricketer, who might be an acquisition
to a country club, would have his wicket struck down at the first
bowl at <em>Lord’s-ground</em>. The same person is frequently dull at one
time and brilliant at another: sometimes those who are most silent at
the beginning of an entertainment are most loquacious at the end.
There is a <em>run in the luck</em> both in cards and conversation. Some
people are good speakers but bad hearers: these are put out, unless
they have all the talk to themselves. Some are best in a <em>tête-à-tête</em>;
others in a mixed company. Some persons talk well on a set subject,
who can hardly answer a common question, still less pay a compliment
or make a <em>repartee</em>. Conversation may be divided into the <em>personal</em>
or the <em>didactic</em>: the one resembles the style of a lecture, the other
that of a comedy. There are as many who fail in conversation from
aiming at too high a standard of excellence, and wishing only to utter
oracles or <em>jeux-d’esprit</em>, as there are who expose themselves from
having no standard at all, and saying whatever comes into their heads.
Pedants and gossips compose the largest class. Numbers talk on
without paying any attention to the effect they produce upon their
audience: some few take no part in the discourse but by assenting to
everything that is said, and these are not the worst companions in
the world. An outcry is sometimes raised against dull people, as if
it were any fault of theirs. The most brilliant performers very soon
grow dull, and we like people to begin as they end. There is then
no disappointment nor false excitement. The great ingredient in
society is good-will. He who is pleased with what he himself has to say,
and listens in his turn with patience and good-humour, is wise and
witty enough for us. We do not covet those parties where one wit
dares not go, because another is expected. How delectable must the
encounter of such pretenders be to one another! How edifying to
the bye-standers!</p>

<p class='c007'>IX. It was well said by Mr. Coleridge, that people never improve
by contradiction, but by <em>agreeing to differ</em>. If you discuss a question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>amicably you may gain a clear insight into it; if you dispute about it
you only throw dust in one another’s eyes. In all angry or violent
controversy, your object is not to learn wisdom, but to prove your
adversary a fool; and in this respect, it must be admitted, both parties
usually succeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>X. Envy is the ruling passion of mankind. The explanation is
obvious. As we are of infinitely more importance in our own eyes
than all the world beside, the chief bent and study of the mind is
directed to impress others with this self-evident but disputed distinction,
and to arm ourselves with the exclusive signatures and credentials of
our superiority, and to hate and stifle all that stands in the way of, or
obscures, our absurd pretensions. Each individual looks upon himself
in the light of a dethroned monarch, and the rest of the world as his
rebellious subjects and runaway slaves, who withhold the homage that
is his natural due, and burst the chains of opinion he would impose
upon them: the madman in Hogarth (sooth to say), with his
crown of straw and wooden sceptre, is but a type and <em>common-place</em>
emblem of every-day life.</p>

<p class='c007'>XI. It has been made a subject of regret that in forty or fifty
years’ time (if we go on as we have done) no one will read Fielding.
What a falling off! Already, if you thoughtlessly lend <em>Joseph
Andrews</em> to a respectable family, you find it returned upon your hands
as an improper book. To be sure, people read ‘Don Juan’; but <em>that</em>
is in verse. The worst is, that this senseless fastidiousness is more
owing to an affectation of gentility than to a disgust at vice. It is
not the scenes that are described at an alehouse, but the <em>alehouse</em> at
which they take place that gives the mortal stab to taste and refinement.
One comfort is, that the manners and characters which are
objected to as <em>low</em> in Fielding have in a great measure disappeared or
taken another shape; and this at least is one good effect of all excellent
satire—that it destroys ‘the very food whereon it lives.’ The
generality of readers, who only seek for the representation of existing
models, must therefore, after a time, seek in vain for this obvious
verisimilitude in the most powerful and popular works of the kind;
and will be either disgusted or at a loss to understand the application.
People of sense and imagination, who look beyond the surface or the
passing folly of the day, will always read <cite>Tom Jones</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>XII. There is a set of critics and philosophers who have never read
anything but what has appeared within the last ten years, and to
whom every mode of expression or turn of thought extending beyond
that period has a very odd effect. They cannot comprehend how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>people used such out-of-the-way phrases in the time of Shakspeare;
the style of Addison would not do now—even Junius, they think,
would make but a shabby <em>thread-bare</em> figure in the columns of a
modern newspaper—all the riches that the language has acquired in
the course of time, all the idiomatic resources arising from study or
accident, are utterly discarded—sink under-ground: and all that is
admired by the weak or sought after by the vain, is a thin surface of
idle affectation and glossy innovations. Even spelling and pronunciation
have undergone such changes within a short time, that Pope and
Swift require a little <em>modernizing</em> to accommodate them to ‘ears
polite;’ and that a <em>bluestocking belle</em> would be puzzled in reciting
Dryden’s sounding verse with its occasional barbarous, old-fashioned
accenting, if it were the custom to read Dryden aloud in those serene,
morning circles. There is no class more liable to set up this narrow
superficial standard, than people of fashion, in their horror of what is
vulgar and ignorance of what really is so; they have a jargon of their
own, but scout whatever does not fall in with it as Gothic and <em>outré</em>;
the English phrases handed down from the last age they think come
east of Temple-bar, and they perform a sedulous quarantine against
them. The <cite>Times</cite>, having found it so written in some outlandish
<em>depêche</em> of the Marquis of Wellesley’s, chose as a mark of the <em>haute
literature</em>, to spell <em>dispatch</em> with an <em>e</em>, and for a long time he was held
for a novice or an affected and absolute writer who spelt it otherwise.
The <em>Globe</em>, with its characteristic good sense and sturdiness of spirit
has restored the old English spelling in defiance of scandal. Some
persons who were growing jealous that the author of <cite>Waverley</cite> had
eclipsed their favourite luminaries may make themselves easy; he
himself is on the wane with those whose opinions ebb and flow with
the ‘inconstant moon’ of fashion, and has given way (if Mr. Colburn’s
advertisements speak true, ‘than which what’s truer?’) to a set of titled
nonentities. Nothing solid is to go down, or that is likely to last
three months; instead of the standing dishes of old English literature
we are to take up with the <em>nicknacks</em> and whipt syllabubs of modern
taste; are to be occupied with a stream of titlepages, extracts, and
specimens, like passing figures in a <em>camera obscura</em>, and are to be
puzzled in a mob of new books as in the mob of new faces in what
was formerly the narrow part of the Strand.</p>

<p class='c007'>XIII. Never pity people because they are ill-used. They only wait
the opportunity to use others just as ill. Hate the oppression and
prevent the evil if you can; but do not fancy there is any virtue in
being oppressed, or any love lost between the parties. The unfortunate
are not a jot more amiable than their neighbours, though they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>give themselves out so, and our pity takes part with those who have
disarmed our envy.</p>

<p class='c007'>XIV. The human mind seems to improve, because it is continually
in progress. But as it moves forward to new acquisitions and trophies,
it loses its hold on those which formerly were its chief boast and
employment. Men are better chemists than they were, but worse
divines; they read the newspapers, it is true, but neglect the classics.
Everything has its turn. Neither is error extirpated so much as it
takes a new form and puts on a more artful disguise. Folly shifts its
ground, but finds its level: absurdity is never left without a subterfuge.
The dupes of dreams and omens in former times, are now the converts
to graver and more solemn pieces of quackery. The race of the sanguine,
the visionary, and the credulous, of those who believe what they
wish, or what excites their wonder, in preference to what they know,
or can have rationally explained, will never wear out; and they only
transfer their innate love of the marvellous from old and exploded
chimeras to fashionable theories, and the <em>terra incognita</em> of modern
science.</p>

<p class='c007'>XV. It is a curious speculation to take a modern <em>belle</em>, or some
accomplished female acquaintance, and conceive what her great-great-grandmother
was like, some centuries ago. Who was the Mrs. ——
of the year 200? We have some standard of grace and elegance
among eastern nations 3000 years ago, because we read accounts of
them in history; but we have no more notion of, or faith in, our own
ancestors than if we had never had any. We <em>cut the connexion</em> with
the Druids and the Heptarchy; and cannot fancy ourselves (by any
transformation) inmates of caves and woods, or feeders on acorns and
sloes. We seem <em>engrafted</em> on that low stem—a bright, airy, and
insolent excrescence.</p>

<p class='c007'>XVI. There is this advantage in painting, if there were no
other, that it is the truest and most self-evident kind of history.
It shows that there were people long ago, and also <em>what</em> they
were, not in a book darkly, but face to face. It is not the half-formed
clay, the old-fashioned dress, as we might conceive; but
the living lineaments, the breathing expression. You look at a
picture by Vandyke, and there see as in an enchanted mirror,
an English woman of quality two hundred years ago, sitting in
unconscious state with her child playing at her feet, and with all
the dove-like innocence of look, the grace and refinement that it is
possible for virtue and breeding to bestow. It is enough to make us
proud of our nature and our countrywomen; and dissipates at once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>the idle, <em>upstart</em> prejudice that all before our time was sordid and
scarce civilised. If our progress does not appear so great as our presumption
has suggested, what does it signify? With such models
kept in view, our chief object ought to be not to degenerate; and
though the future prospect is less gaudy and imposing, the retrospect
opens a larger and brighter <em>vista</em> of excellence.</p>

<p class='c007'>XVII. I am by education and conviction inclined to republicanism
and puritanism. In America they have both; but I confess I feel a
little staggered in the practical efficacy and saving grace of <em>first principles</em>,
when I ask myself, ‘Can they throughout the United States,
from Boston to Baltimore, produce a single head like one of Titian’s
Venetian nobles, nurtured in all the pride of aristocracy and all the
blindness of popery?’ Of all the branches of political economy, the
human face is perhaps the best criterion of <em>value</em>.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>COMMON SENSE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>October 11, 1829.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>Common sense is a rare and enviable quality. It may be truly said
that ‘its price is above rubies.’ How many learned men, how many
wits, how many geniuses, how many dull and ignorant people, how
many cunning knaves, how many well-meaning fools are without it!
How few have it, and how little do they or others know of it, except
from the infallible results—for one of its first requisites is the utter
absence of all pretension! The vulgar laugh at the pedant and
enthusiast for the want of it, while they themselves mistake bigotry
and narrow-minded notions for it. It is not one of the sciences, but
has been well pronounced to be ‘fairly worth the seven.’ It is a
kind of mental instinct, that feels the air of truth and propriety as the
fingers feel objects of touch. It does not consist with ignorance,
for we cannot pronounce on what we do not know; and on the other
hand, the laying in a stock of knowledge, or mastering any art or
science, seems to destroy that native simplicity, and to warp and
trammel the unbiassed freedom of mind which is necessary to its
receiving and giving their due weight to ordinary and casual impressions.
Common sense is neither a peculiar talent nor a laborious
acquirement, but may be regarded as a sound and impartial judgment
operating on the daily practice of life, or on what ‘comes home to
the business and bosoms of men’; combined with great attainments
and speculative inquiries, it would justly earn the title of <em>wisdom</em>; but
of the latter we have never known a single instance, though we have
met with a few of the former; that is, we have known a number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>persons who were wise in the affairs of the world and in what
concerned their own interest, but none who, beyond this, and in
judging of general questions, were not the dupes of some flaw of
temper, of some weakness or vanity, or even striking advantage of
their own. To give an example of two in illustration. A person
may be an excellent scholar, a good mathematician, well versed in
law and history, a first-rate chess-player, a dazzling fencer, in a word,
a sort of <em>admirable Crichton</em>—you are disposed to admire or envy so
many talents united—you smile to see him wanting in common sense,
and getting into a dispute about a <em>douceur</em> to a paltry police-officer,
and thinking to interest all Europe and both Houses of Parliament in
his success. It is true, he has law and reason on his side, has Grotius
and Puffendorf and the <em>statutes at large</em> doubled down in dog-ears for
the occasion, has a vast and lively apparatus of well-arranged premises
and conclusions ready to play off against his adversaries; but he does
not consider that he has to deal with interest and custom, those
impalpable, intangible essences, that ‘fear no discipline of human wit.’
Does he think to check-mate the police? Will he stop the mouth of
a hungry tide-waiter with a syllogism? Or supersede a perquisite by
the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>? It is a want of common sense, or the
not distinguishing properly between the definite and the indefinite.
No one can have arrived at years of discretion without knowing or
feeling that he cannot take a single step without some compromise
with existing circumstances; that the path of life is intercepted with
innumerable turnpike-gates, at which he must pay down the toll of
his own convictions and of strict justice; that he cannot walk the
streets but by tacit allowance; and that to disregard all impediments
in the right line of reason and written forms is to imitate the conduct
of <em>Commodore Trunnion</em>, who mistook the land for the sea, and went
to be married by the wind and compass. The proofs of this occur
every hour of the day—they may not be registered, they may not be
remembered, but they are virtually and effectively noted down by the
faculty of common sense, which does not feel its way the less surely
because it proceeds often mechanically and blindly. There may be
exceptions indeed to ordinary rules, on which a man may go to
martyrdom and a stake (such as that of Hampden and ship-money),
but these occur once in a century, and are only met with at the corners
of streets by those who have an excess of logical discrimination, and
have to pay a certain tax for being too clever by half. It is the
fashion at present among the philosophical vulgar to decry <em>feeling</em>, both
the name and the thing. It would be difficult, however, to do without
it: for this word embraces all that mass of knowledge and of
common sense which lies between the extremes of positive proof or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>demonstration and downright ignorance; and those who would
pragmatically confine their own convictions or those of others to what
is absolutely known and understood, would at best become scientific
pedants and artificial barbarians. There are some persons who are
the victims of argument; as there are others who are the slaves of
minute details and matters of fact. One class will have a reason for
every thing, and will admit the greatest absurdities that are formally
proposed to them; the other must have facts to support every
conclusion, and can never see an inch beyond their noses. The last
have the <em>organ of individuality</em> largely developed, and are proportionably
deficient in common sense. Their ideas are all local and literal.
To borrow the language of a great but obscure metaphysician, their
minds are <em>epileptic</em>; that is, are in perpetual throes and convulsions,
fasten on every object in their way not to help but to hinder their
progress, and have no voluntary power to let go their hold of a
particular circumstance, to grasp the whole of any question, or
suspend their judgment for an instant. The fact that is before them
is every thing; the rest goes for nothing. They are always at cross-purposes
with themselves, for their decisions are the result of the last
evidence, without any corrective or qualifier in common sense; in the
hunt after proofs, they forget their principles, and gain their point,
though they lose their cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Scotch have much of this <em>matter-of-fact</em> understanding, and
bigotry to personal and actual statistics. They would persuade you
that there is no country but Scotland, nothing but what is Scotch.
Mr. Mac Alpine shifts the discourse from the metropolis, hurries
rapidly over the midland counties, crosses the border, and sits down
to an exordium in praise of the ‘kindly Scot.’ Charity has its home
and hearth by Tweed-side, where he was born and bred, Scotch
beggars were quite different from English beggars: there was none
of the hard-heartedness towards them that was always shown in
England. His mother, though not a rich woman, always received
them kindly, and had a bag of meal out of which she always gave
them something, as they went their rounds. ‘Lord! Mr. Mac
Alpine!’ says Mrs. Mac Alpine, ‘other people have mothers as
well as you, and there are beggars in England as well as Scotland.
Why, in Yorkshire, where I was brought up, common beggars used
to come round just as you describe, and my mother, who was no
richer than yours, used to give them a crust of bread or broken
victuals just in the same way; you make such a <em>fuss</em> about nothing.’

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>If no great philosophers, they do not want common sense; and are
only misled in what lies beyond their sphere of feeling and observation,
by taking up the opinions of their <em>better halves</em>. The common
people in like manner do not want common sense in what falls under
their especial cognizance and daily practice. A country-shoemaker
or plough-man understands shoemaking, and can ‘crack of ploughs and
kine,’ though he knows nothing of the Catholic question. If an old
woman in a country-town believes she shall be burnt at a stake, now
that this question is settled, it is because she is told so by those who
ought to know better, and who impose <em>their</em> prejudices upon <em>her</em>
ignorance. Vulgar errors which are taken on trust, or are traditional,
or are the blunders of ignorance on points of learning, have nothing to
do with common sense, which decides only on facts and feelings
which have come under its own notice. Common sense and <em>common-place</em>
are also the antipodes of each other: the one is a collection of
true experiences, the other a routine of cant phrases. All affectation
is the death of common sense, which requires the utmost simplicity
and sincerity. Liars must be without common sense, for instead of
considering what things really are, their whole time and attention are
taken up in imposing false appearances on themselves and their neighbours.
No conceited person can have the faculty we have been
speaking of, since all objects are tinged and changed from their proper
hue by the idle reflection of their fancied excellence and superiority.
Great talkers are in the same predicament, for they sacrifice truth to
a fine speech or sentiment, and conceal the real consequences of things
from their view by a cloud of words, of empty breath. They look
at nature not to study what it is, but to discover what they can say
about it. Passionate people are generally thought to be devoid of
judgment. They may be so, when their passions are touched to the
quick; but without a certain degree of natural irritability, we do not
conceive truth leaves sufficient stings in the mind, and we judge
correctly of things according to the interest we take in them. No
one can be a physiognomist, for example, or have an insight into
character and expression, without the correspondent germs of these in
his own breast. Phlegmatic C——, with all his husbandry acquirements,
is but half a philosopher, half a clown. Poets, if they have
not common sense, can do very well without it. What need have
they to conform their ideas to the actual world, when they can create
a world according to their fancy? We know of no remedy for want
of tact and insight into human affairs, any more than for the defect of
any other organ. <cite>Tom Jones</cite> is, we think, the best horn-book for
students in this way; and if the novice should rise up no wiser from
its repeated perusal, at least such an employment of his time will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>better than playing the fool or talking nonsense. After all, the most
absurd characters are those who are so, not from a want of common
sense, but who act in defiance of their better knowledge. The
capricious and fickle who change every moment, the perverse who
aim only at what is placed out of their reach, the obstinate who
pursue a losing cause, the idle and vicious who ruin themselves and
every one connected with them, do it as often with their eyes open as
from blind infatuation; and it is the bias of their wills, not the
deficiency of their understandings, that is in fault. The greatest fools
in practice are sometimes the wisest men in theory, for they have all
the advantage of their own experience and self-reflection to prompt
them; and they can give the best advice to others, though they do
not conceive themselves bound to follow it in their own instance.
<em>Video meliora proboque</em>, etc. Their judgments may be clear and just,
but their habits and affections lie all the wrong way; and it is as
useless as it would be cruel to expect them to reform, since they only
delight and can only exist in their darling absurdities and daily and
hourly <em>escapades</em> from common sense and reason.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE SPIRIT OF CONTROVERSY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>January 31, 1830.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>The Spirit of Controversy has often been arraigned as the source of
much bitterness and vexation, as productive of ‘envy, malice, and all
uncharitableness’: and the charge, no doubt, is too well founded.
But it is said to be <em>an ill wind that blows nobody good</em>; and there are
few evils in life that have not some qualifying circumstance attending
them. It is one of the worst consequences of this very spirit of
controversy that it has led men to regard things too much in a single
and exaggerated point of view. Truth is not one thing, but has
many aspects and many shades of difference; it is neither all black
nor all white; sees something wrong on its own side, something right
in others; makes concessions to an adversary, allowances for human
frailty, and is nearer akin to charity than the dealers in controversy
or the declaimers against it are apt to imagine. The bigot and
partisan (influenced by the very spirit he finds fault with) sees nothing
in the endless disputes which have tormented and occupied men’s
thoughts but an abuse of learning and a waste of time: the philosopher
may still find an excuse for so bad and idle a practice. One frequent
objection made to the incessant wrangling and collision of sects and
parties is, <em>What does it all come to?</em> And the answer is, <em>What would
they have done without it?</em> The pleasure of the chase, or the benefit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>derived from it, is not to be estimated by the value of the game after
it is caught, so much as by the difficulty of starting it and the exercise
afforded to the body and the excitement of the animal spirits in
hunting it down: and so it is in the exercises of the mind and the
pursuit of truth, which are chiefly valuable (perhaps) less for their
results when discovered, than for their affording continual scope and
employment to the mind in its endeavours to reach the fancied goal,
without its being ever (or but seldom) able to attain it. <em>Regard the
end</em>, is an ancient saying, and a good one, if it does not mean that we
are to forget the <em>beginning</em> and the <em>middle</em>. By insisting on the ultimate
value of things when all is over, we may acquire the character
of <em>grave</em> men, but not of wise ones. <em>Passe pour cela.</em> If we would
set up such a sort of fixed and final standard of moral truth and
worth, we had better try to construct life over again, so as to make it
a <em>punctum stans</em>, and not a thing in progress; for as it is, every
end, before it can be realised, implies a previous imagination, a
warm interest in, and an active pursuit of, itself, all which are integral
and vital parts of human existence, and it is a begging of the question
to say that an end is only of value in itself, and not as it draws out
the living resources, and satisfies the original capacities of human
nature. When the play is over, the curtain drops, and we see nothing
but a green cloth; but before this, there have been five acts of brilliant
scenery and high-wrought declamation, which, if we come to plain
matter-of-fact and history, are still something. According to the
contrary theory, nothing is real but a blank. This flatters the
paradoxical pride of man, whose motto is, <em>all or none</em>. Look at that
pile of school divinity! Behold where the demon of controversy lies
buried! The huge tomes are mouldy and worm-eaten:—did their
contents the less eat into the brain, or corrode the heart, or stir the
thoughts, or fill up the void of lassitude and <em>ennui</em> in the minds of
those who wrote them? Though now laid aside and forgotten, if
they had not once had a host of readers, they would never have been
written; and their hard and solid bulk asked the eager tooth of
curiosity and zeal to pierce through it. We laugh to see their
ponderous dulness weighed in scales, and sold for waste paper. We
should not laugh too soon. On the smallest difference of faith or
practice discussed in them, the fate of kingdoms hung suspended;
and not merely so (which was a trifle) but Heaven and Hell trembled
in the balance, according to the full persuasion of our pious forefathers.
Many a drop of blood flowed in the field or on the scaffold, from these
tangled briars and thorns of controversy; many a man marched to a
stake to bear testimony to the most frivolous and incomprehensible of
their dogmas. This was an untoward consequence; but if it was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>evil to be burnt at a stake, it was well and becoming to have an
opinion (whether right or wrong) for which a man was willing to be
burnt at a stake. Read Baxter’s <em>Controversial Works</em>: consider the
flames of zeal, the tongues of fire, the heights of faith, the depths of
subtlety, which they unfold, as in a darkly illuminated scroll; and
then ask how much we are gainers by an utter contempt and indifference
to all this? We wonder at the numberless volumes of sermons
that have been written, preached, and printed on the Arian and
Socinian controversies, on Calvinism and Arminianism, on surplices
and stoles, on infant or adult baptism, on image-worship and the
defacing of images; and we forget that it employed the preacher all
the week to prepare his sermon (be the subject what it would) for
the next Lord’s day, with infinite collating of texts, authorities, and
arguments; that his flock were no less edified by listening to it on
the following Sunday; and how many <em>David Deans’s</em> came away
convinced that they had been listening to the ‘root of the matter’!
See that group collected after service-time and pouring over the gravestones
in the churchyard, from whence, to the eye of faith, a light
issues that points to the skies! See them disperse; and as they take
different paths homeward while the evening closes in, still discoursing
of the true doctrine and the glad tidings they have heard, how ‘their
hearts burn within them by the way’! Then again, we should set
down, among other items in the account, how the schoolboy is put
to it to remember the text, and how the lazy servant-wench starts up
to find herself asleep in church-time! Such is the business of human
life; and we, who fancy ourselves above it, are only so much the
more taken up with follies of our own. We look down in this age
of reason on those controverted points and nominal distinctions which
formerly kept up such ‘a coil and pudder’ in the world, as idle and
ridiculous, because we are not parties to them; but if it was the
<em>egotism</em> of our predecessors that magnified them beyond all rational
bounds, it is no less egotism in us who undervalue their opinions and
pursuits because they are not ours; and, indeed, to leave egotism out
of human nature, is ‘to leave the part of <cite>Hamlet</cite> out of the play of
<cite>Hamlet</cite>.’ Or what are we the better with our <em>Utilitarian Controversies</em>,
Mr. Taylor’s discourses (delivered in canonicals) against the
evidence of the Christian religion, or the changes of ministry and
disagreements between the Duke of Wellington and the Duke of
Newcastle?</p>

<p class='c007'>But the prevalence of religious controversy is reproached with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>fomenting spiritual pride and intolerance, and sowing heart-burnings,
jealousies, and fears, ‘like a thick scurf o’er life;’ yet, had it not
been for this, we should have been tearing one another to pieces like
savages for fragments of raw flesh, or quarrelling with a herd of swine
for a windfall of acorns under an oak-tree. The world has never yet
done, and will never be able to do, without some apple of discord—some
bone of contention—any more than courts of law can do without
pleadings, or hospitals without the sick. When a thing ceases to be
a subject of controversy, it ceases to be a subject of interest. Why
need we regret the various hardships and persecutions for conscience-sake,
when men only clung closer to their opinions in consequence?
They loved their religion in proportion as they paid dear for it.
Nothing could keep the Dissenters from going to a conventicle while
it was declared an unlawful assembly, and was the highroad to a
prison or the plantations—take away tests and fines, and make the
road open and easy, and the sect dwindles gradually into insignificance.
A thing is supposed to be worth nothing that costs nothing. Besides,
there is always pretty nearly the same quantity of malice afloat in the
world; though with the change of time and manners it may become
a finer poison, and kill by more unseen ways. When the sword has
done its worst, slander, ‘whose edge is sharper than the sword,’ steps
in to keep the blood from stagnating. Instead of slow fires and paper
caps fastened round the heads of the victims, we arrive at the same
end by a politer way of nicknames and anonymous criticism. <cite>Blackwood’s
Magazine</cite> is the modern version of Fox’s <em>Book of Martyrs</em>.
Discard religion and politics (the two grand topics of controversy),
and people would hate each other as cordially, and torment each other
as effectually about the preference to be given to Mozart or Rossini,
to Malibran or Pasta. We indeed fix upon the most excellent things,
as God, our country, and our King, to account for the excess of our
zeal; but this depends much less upon the goodness of our cause
than on the strength of our passions, and our overflowing gall and
rooted antipathy to whatever stands in the way of our conceit and
obstinacy. We set up an idol (as we set up a mark to shoot at) for
others to bow down to, on peril of our utmost displeasure, let the
value of it be what it may——</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Of whatsoe’er descent his Godhead be,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stock, stone, or other homely pedigree,</div>
      <div class='line'>In his defence his servants are as bold</div>
      <div class='line'>As if he had been born of beaten gold.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is, however, but fair to add, in extenuation of the evils of controversy,
that if the points at issue had been quite clear, or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>advantage all on one side, they would not have been so liable to be
contested about. We condemn controversy, because we would have
matters all our own way, and think that ours is the only side that has
a title to be heard. We imagine that there is but one view of a
subject that is right; and that all the rest being plainly and wilfully
wrong, it is a shocking waste of speech, and a dreadful proof of prejudice
and party spirit, to have a word to say in their defence. But
this is a want of liberality and comprehension of mind. For in
general we dispute either about things respecting which we are a good
deal in the dark, and where both parties are very possibly in the
wrong, and may be left to find out their mutual error; or about those
points, where there is an opposition of interests and passions, and
where it would be by no means safe to cut short the debate by
making one party judges for the other. They must, therefore, be
left to fight it out as well as they can; and, between the extremes
of folly and violence, to strike a balance of common sense and
even-handed justice. Every sect or party will, of course, run into
extravagance and partiality; but the probability is, that there is some
ground of argument, some appearance of right, to justify the grossest
bigotry and intolerance. The fury of the combatants is excited
because there is something to be said on the other side of the
question. If men were as infallible as they suppose themselves, they
would not dispute. If every novelty were well founded, truth might
be discovered by a receipt; but as antiquity does not always turn out
an old woman, this accounts for the <em>vis inertiæ</em> of the mind in so often
pausing and setting its face against innovation. Authority has some
advantages to recommend it as well as reason, or it would long ago
have been scouted. Aristocracy and democracy, monarchy and
republicanism, are not all pure good or pure evil, though the abettors
or antagonists of each think so, and that all the mischief arises from
others entertaining any doubt about the question, and insisting on
carrying their absurd theories into practice. The French and English
are grossly prejudiced against each other; but still the interests
of each are better taken care of under this exaggerated notion than
if that vast mass of rights and pretensions, which each is struggling
for, were left to the tender mercies and ruthless candour of the other
side. ‘<em>Every man for himself and God for us all</em>’ is a rule that will
apply here. Controversy, therefore, is a necessary evil or good (call
it which you will) till all differences of opinion or interest are reconciled,
and absolute certainty or perfect indifference alike takes away
the possibility or the temptation to litigation and quarrels. We need
be under no immediate alarm of coming to such a conclusion. There
is always room for doubt, food for contention. While we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>engrossed with one controversy, indeed, we think every thing else is
clear; but as soon as one point is settled, we begin to cavil and start
objections to that which has before been taken for gospel. The
Reformers thought only of opposing the Church of Rome, and never
once anticipated the schisms and animosities which arose among
Protestants: the Dissenters, in carrying their point against the Church
of England, did not dream of that crop of infidelity and scepticism
which, to their great horror and scandal, sprung up in the following
age, from their claim of free inquiry and private judgment. The
<em>non-essentials</em> of religion first came into dispute; then the essentials.
Our own opinion, we fancy, is founded on a rock; the rest we regard
as stubble. But no sooner is one out-work of established faith or
practice demolished, than another is left a defenceless mark for the
enemy, and the engines of wit and sophistry immediately begin to
batter it. Thus we proceed step by step, till, passing through the
several gradations of vanity and paradox, we came to doubt whether
we stand on our head or our heels, alternately deny the existence of
spirit and matter, maintain that black is white, call evil good and good
evil, and defy any one to prove the contrary. As faith is the prop
and cement that upholds society by opposing fixed principles as a
barrier against the inroads of passion, so reason is the <em>menstruum</em>
which dissolves it by leaving nothing sufficiently firm or unquestioned
in our opinions to withstand the current and bias of inclination.
Hence the decay and ruin of states—then barbarism, sloth, and
ignorance—and so we commence the circle again of building up all
that it is possible to conceive out of a rude chaos, and the obscure
shadowings of things, and then pulling down all that we have built up,
till not a trace of it is left. Such is the effect of the ebb and flow
and restless agitation of the human mind.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ENVY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>February 14, 1830.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>Envy is the <em>grudging</em> or receiving pain from any accomplishment or
advantage possessed by another. It is one of the most tormenting and
odious of the passions, inasmuch as it does not consist in the enjoyment
or pursuit of any good to ourselves, but in the hatred and jealousy of
the good fortune of others and the debarring and defrauding them of
their due and what is of no use to us, on the <em>dog in the manger</em> principle;
and it is at the same time as mean as it is revolting, as being accompanied
with a sense of weakness and a desire to conceal and tamper
with the truth and its own convictions, out of paltry spite and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>vanity. It is, however, but an excess or excrescence of the other
passions (such as pride or avarice) or of a wish to monopolise all
the good things of life to ourselves, which makes us impatient and
dissatisfied at seeing any one else in possession of that to which we
think we have the only fair title. Envy is the deformed and distorted
offspring of <em>egotism</em>; and when we reflect on the strange and disproportioned
character of the parent, we cannot wonder at the perversity
and waywardness of the child. Such is the absorbing and exorbitant
quality of our self-love, that it represents us as of infinitely more
importance in our own eyes than the whole universe put together, and
would sacrifice the claims and interest of all the world beside to the
least of its caprices or extravagances; need we be surprised then that
this little, upstart, overweening self, that would trample on the globe
itself and then weep for new ones to conquer, should be uneasy, mad,
mortified, eaten up with chagrin and melancholy, and hardly able to
bear its own existence, at seeing a single competitor among the
crowd cross its path, jostle its pretensions, and stagger its opinion of
its exclusive right to admiration and superiority? This it is that
constitutes the offence, that gives the shock, that inflicts the wound,
that some poor creature (as we would fain suppose) whom we had
before overlooked and entirely disregarded as not worth our notice,
should of a sudden enter the lists and challenge comparison with us.
The presumption is excessive; and so is our thirst of revenge.
From the moment, however, that the eye fixes on another as the
object of envy, we cannot take it off; for our pride and self-conceit
magnify that which obstructs our success and lessens our self-importance
into a monster; we see nothing else, we hear of nothing
else, we dream of nothing else, it haunts us and takes possession of
our whole souls; and as we are engrossed by it ourselves, so we fancy
that all the rest of the world are equally taken up with our petty
annoyances and disappointed pride. Hence the ‘jealous leer malign’
of envy, which, not daring to look that which provokes it in the face,
cannot yet keep its eyes from it, and gloats over and becomes as it
were enamoured of the very object of its loathing and deadly hate.
We pay off the score which our littleness and vanity has been running
up, by ample and gratuitous concessions to the first person that gives
a check to our swelling self-complacency, and forces us to drag him
into an unwilling comparison with ourselves. It is no matter who
the person is, what his pretensions—if they are a counterpoise to
our own, we think them of more consequence than anything else in
the world. This often gives rise to laughable results. We see the
jealousies among servants, hackney-coachmen, cobblers in a stall; we
are amused with the rival advertisements of quacks and stage-coach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>proprietors, and smile to read the significant intimation on some shop
window, ‘No connection with the next door;’ but the same folly runs
through the whole of life; each person thinks that he who stands in
his way or outstrips him in a particular pursuit, is the most enviable,
and at the same time the most hateful character in the world.
Nothing can show the absurdity of the passion of envy in a more
striking point of view than the number of rival claims which it
entirely overlooks, while it would arrogate all excellence to itself.
The loftiness of our ambition and the narrowness of our views are equal,
and indeed both depend upon the same cause. The player envies
only the player, the poet envies only the poet, because each confines
his idea of excellence to his own profession and pursuit, and thinks,
if he could but remove some hapless competitor out of his way, he
should have a clear stage to himself, or be a ‘Phœnix gazed by
all:’ as if, though we crushed one rival, another would not start up;
or as if there were not a thousand other claims, a thousand other
modes of excellence and praiseworthy acquirements, to divide the
palm and defeat his idle pretension to the sole and unqualified
admiration of mankind. Professors of every class see merit only in
their own line; yet they would blight and destroy that <em>little bit</em> of
excellence which alone they acknowledge to exist, except as it centres
in themselves. Speak in praise of an actor to another actor, and he
turns away with impatience and disgust: speak disparagingly of the
first as an actor in general, and the latter eagerly takes up the quarrel
as his own: thus the <em>esprit de corps</em> only comes in as an appendage
to our self-love. It is perhaps well that we are so blind to merit out
of our immediate sphere, for it might only prove an additional <em>eye-sore</em>,
increase the obliquity of our mental vision, multiply our antipathies,
or end in total indifference and despair. There is nothing so bad as a
cynical apathy and contempt for every art and science from a superficial
<em>smattering</em> and general acquaintance with them all. The merest
pedantry and the most tormenting jealousy and heart-burnings of envy
are better than this. Those who are masters of different advantages
and accomplishments, are seldom the more satisfied with them: they
still aim at something else (however contemptible) which they have
not or cannot do. So Pope says of Wharton—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Though wondering senates hung on all he spoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>The club must hail him master of the joke.</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall parts so various aim at nothing new?</div>
      <div class='line'>He’ll shine a Tully and a Wilmot too.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The world, indeed, are pretty even with these constellations of
splendid and superfluous qualities in their fastidious estimate of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>own pretensions, for (if possible) they never give any individual
credit for more than one leading attainment. If a man is an artist,
his being a fine musician adds nothing to his fame. When the
public strain a point to own one claim, it is on condition that
the fortunate candidate waives every other. The mind is prepared
with a plausible antithesis in such cases against the formidable
encroachments of vanity: one qualification is regularly made a foil
to another. We allow no one to be two things at a time: it quite
unsettles our notions of personal identity. If we allow a man
wit, it is part of the bargain that he wants judgment: if style he
wants matter. Rich, but a fool or miser—a beauty, but vain; <em>so
runs the bond</em>. ‘But’ is the favourite monosyllable of envy and self-love.
Raphael could draw and Titian could colour—we shall never
get beyond this point while the world stands; the human understanding
is not cast in a mould to receive double proofs of entire superiority
to itself. It is folly to expect it. If a farther claim be set up,
we call in question the solidity of the first, incline to retract it, and
suspect that the whole is a juggle and a piece of impudence, as we
threaten a common beggar with the stocks for following us to ask a
second alms. This is, in fact, one source of the prevalence and deep
root which envy has in the human mind: we are incredulous as to
the truth and justice of the demands which are so often made upon our
pity or our admiration; but let the distress or the merit be established
beyond all controversy, and we open our hearts and purses on the
spot, and sometimes run into the contrary extreme when charity
or admiration becomes the fashion. No one envies the <em>Author of
Waverley</em>, because all admire him, and are sensible that admire
him how they will, they can never admire him enough. We do
not envy the sun for shining, when we feel the benefit and see
the light. When some persons start an injudicious parallel between
him and Shakspeare, we then may grow jealous and uneasy, because
this interferes with our older and more firmly rooted conviction of
genius, and one which has stood a severer and surer test. Envy has,
then, some connexion with a sense of justice—is a defence against
imposture and quackery. Though we do not willingly give up the
secret and silent consciousness of our own worth to vapouring and
false pretences, we do homage to the true candidate for fame when
he appears, and even exult and take a pride in our capacity to appreciate
the highest desert. This is one reason why we do not envy the dead—less
because they are removed out of our way, than because all doubt
and diversity of opinion is dismissed from the question of their title to
veneration and respect. Our tongue, having a license, grows wanton
in their praise. We do not envy or stint our admiration of Rubens,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>because the mists of uncertainty or prejudice are withdrawn by
the hand of time from the splendour of his works. Fame is to
genius—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like to a gate of steel fronting the sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>That renders back its figure and its heat.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We give full and unbounded scope to our impressions when they are
confirmed by successive generations; as we form our opinions coldly
and slowly while we are afraid our judgment may be reversed by
posterity. We trust the testimony of ages, for it is true; we are no
longer in pain lest we should be deceived by varnish and tinsel;
and feel assured that the praise and the work are both sterling. In
contemporary reputation, the greater and more transcendant the merit,
the less is the envy attending it; which shows that this passion is not,
after all, a mere barefaced hatred and detraction from acknowledged
excellence. Mrs. Siddons was not an object of envy; her unrivalled
powers defied competitors or gainsayers. If Kean had a party
against him, it was composed of those who could not or would not
see his merits through his defects; and in like manner, John
Kemble’s elevation to the tragic throne was not carried by loud and
tumultuous acclamation, because the stately height which he attained
was the gradual result of labour and study, and his style of acting did
not flash with the inspiration of the God. We are backward to
bestow a heaped measure of praise, whenever there is any inaptitude
or incongruity that acts to damp or throw a stumbling-block in the way
of our enthusiasm. Hence the jealousy and dislike shown towards
upstart wealth, as we cannot in our imaginations reconcile the former
poverty of the possessors with their present magnificence—we despise
fortune-hunters in ambition as well as in love—and hence, no doubt,
one strong ground of hereditary right. We acquiesce more readily
in an assumption of superiority that in the first place implies no merit
(which is a great relief to the baser sort), and in the second, that
baffles opposition by seeming a thing inevitable, taken for granted,
and transmitted in the common course of nature. In contested
elections, where the precedence is understood to be awarded to rank and
title, there is observed to be less acrimony and obstinacy than when
it is supposed to depend on individual merit and fitness for the office;
no one willingly allows another more ability or honesty than himself,
but he cannot deny that another may be <em>better born</em>. Learning again
is more freely admitted than genius, because it is of a more positive
quality, and is felt to be less essentially a part of a man’s self; and with
regard to the grosser and more invidious distinction of wealth, it may
be difficult to substitute any finer test of respectability for it, since it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>is hard to fathom the depth of a man’s understanding, but the length of
his purse is soon known; and besides, there is a little collusion in the
case:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The learned pate ducks to the golden fool.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We bow to a patron who gives us a good dinner and his countenance
for our pains, and interest bribes and lulls envy asleep. The most
painful kind of envy is the envy towards inferiors; for we cannot bear
to think that a person (in other respects utterly insignificant) should
have or seem to have an advantage over us in any thing we have set
our hearts upon, and it strikes at the very root of our self-love to be
foiled by those we despise. There is some dignity in a contest with
power and acknowledged reputation: but a triumph over the sordid
and the mean is itself a mortification, while a defeat is intolerable.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>ON PREJUDICE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>April 11, 1830.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>Prejudice, in its ordinary and literal sense, is <em>prejudging</em> any question
without having sufficiently examined it, and adhering to our opinion
upon it through ignorance, malice, or perversity, in spite of every
evidence to the contrary. The little that we know has a strong alloy
of misgiving and uncertainty in it: the mass of things of which we
have no means of judging, but of which we form a blind and confident
opinion as if we were thoroughly acquainted with them, is
monstrous. Prejudice is the child of ignorance; for as our actual
knowledge falls short of our desire to know, or curiosity and interest
in the world about us, so must we be tempted to decide upon a greater
number of things at a venture; and having no check from reason or
inquiry, we shall grow more obstinate and bigoted in our conclusions,
according as they have been rash and presumptuous. The absence
of proof, instead of suspending our judgments, only gives us an opportunity
to make things out according to our wishes and fancies; mere
ignorance is a blank canvas on which we lay what colours we please,
and paint objects black or white, as angels or devils, magnify or
diminish them at our option; and in the vacuum either of facts or
arguments, the weight of prejudice and passion falls with double force,
and bears down everything before it. If we enlarge the circle of our
previous knowledge ever so little, we may meet with something to
create doubt and difficulty; but as long as we remain confined to the
cell of our native ignorance, while we know nothing beyond the
routine of sense and custom, we shall refer everything to that standard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>or make it out as we would have it to be, like spoiled children who
have never been from home, and expect to find nothing in the world
that does not accord with their wishes and notions. It is evident,
that the fewer things we know, the more ready we shall be to pronounce
upon and condemn, what is new and strange to us; that is, the
less capable we shall be of varying our conceptions, and the more
prone to mistake a part for the whole. What we do not understand
the meaning of must necessarily appear to us ridiculous and contemptible;
and we do not stop to inquire, till we have been taught by
repeated experiments and warnings of our own fallibility, whether the
absurdity is in ourselves or in the object of our dislike and scorn.
The most ignorant people are rude and insolent, as the most barbarous
are cruel and ferocious. All our knowledge at first lying in a narrow
compass (bounded by local and physical causes) whatever does not
conform to this shocks us as out of reason and nature. The less we
look abroad, the more our ideas are introverted; and our habitual
impressions, from being made up of a few particulars always repeated,
grow together into a kind of concrete substance, which will not bear
taking to pieces, and where the smallest deviation destroys the whole
feeling. Thus the difference of colour in a black man was thought to
forfeit his title to belong to the species, till books of voyages and travels,
and old Fuller’s quaint expression of ‘God’s image carved in ebony,’
have brought the two ideas into a forced union, and Mr. Murray
no longer libels men of colour with impunity. The word <em>republic</em>
has a harsh and incongruous sound to ears bred under a constitutional
monarchy; and we strove hard for many years to overturn the French
republic, merely because we could not reconcile it to ourselves that
such a thing should exist at all, notwithstanding the examples of
Holland, Switzerland, and many others. This term has hardly yet
performed quarantine: to the loyal and patriotic it has an ugly taint
in it, and is scarcely fit to be mentioned in good company. If,
however, we are weaned by degrees from our prejudices against
certain words that shock opinion, this is not the case with all; for
those that offend good manners grow more offensive with the progress
of refinement and civilization, so that no writer now dare venture upon
expressions that unwittingly disfigure the pages of our elder writers,
and in this respect, instead of becoming callous or indifferent, we
appear to become more fastidious every day. There is then a real
grossness which does not depend on familiarity or custom. This
account of the concrete nature of prejudice, or of the manner in which
our ideas by habit and the dearth of general information coalesce
together into one indissoluble form, will show (what otherwise seems
unaccountable) how such violent antipathies and animosities have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>occasioned by the most ridiculous or trifling differences of opinion, or
outward symbols of it; for, by constant custom, and the want of
reflection, the most insignificant of these was as inseparably bound up
with the main principle as the most important, and to give up any
part was to give up the whole essence and vital interests of religion,
morals, and government. Hence we see all sects and parties mutually
insist on their own technical distinctions as the essentials and fundamentals
of religion, and politics, and, for the slightest variation in any
of these, unceremoniously attack their opponents as atheists and
blasphemers, traitors and incendiaries. In fact, these minor points
are laid hold of in preference, as being more obvious and tangible,
and as leaving more room for the exercise of prejudice and passion.
Another thing that makes our prejudices rancorous and inveterate, is,
that as they are taken up without reason, they seem to be <em>self-evident</em>;
and we thence conclude, that they not only are so to ourselves, but
must be so to others, so that their differing from us is wilful,
hypocritical, and malicious. The Inquisition never pretended to
punish its victims for being heretics or infidels, but for avowing
opinions which with their eyes open they knew to be false. That is,
the whole of the Catholic faith, ‘that one entire and perfect chrysolite,’
appeared to them so completely without flaw and blameless,
that they could not conceive how any one else could imagine it to be
otherwise, except from stubbornness and contumacy, and would rather
admit (to avoid so improbable a suggestion) that men went to a
stake for an opinion, not which they held, but counterfeited, and
were content to be burnt for the pleasure of playing the hypocrite.
Nor is it wonderful that there should be so much repugnance to admit
the existence of a serious doubt in matters of such vital and eternal
interest, and on which the whole fabric of the church hinged, since
the first doubt that was expressed on any single point drew all the
rest after it; and the first person who started a conscientious scruple,
and claimed the <em>trial by reason</em>, threw down, as if by a magic spell,
the strongholds of bigotry and superstition, and transferred the determination
of the issue from the blind tribunal of prejudice and implicit
faith to a totally different ground, the fair and open field of argument
and inquiry. On this ground a single champion is a match for
thousands. The decision of the majority is not here enough:
unanimity is absolutely necessary to infallibility; for the only secure
plea on which such a preposterous pretension could be set up is, by
taking it for granted that there can be no possible doubt entertained
upon the subject, and by diverting men’s minds from ever asking
themselves the question of the truth of certain dogmas and mysteries,
any more than whether <em>two and two make four</em>. Prejudice in short
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>is egotism: we see a part, and substitute it for the whole; a thing
strikes us casually and by halves, and we would have the universe
stand proxy for our decision, in order to rivet it more firmly in our
own belief; however insufficient or sinister the grounds of our
opinions, we would persuade ourselves that they arise out of the
strongest conviction, and are entitled to unqualified approbation;
slaves of our own prejudices, caprice, ignorance, we would be lords
of the understandings and reason of others; and (strange infatuation!)
taking up an opinion solely from our own narrow and partial point of
view, without consulting the feelings of others, or the reason of
things, we are still uneasy if all the world do not come into our way
of thinking.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>April 18, 1830.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>The most dangerous enemies to established opinions are those who,
by always defending them, call attention to their weak sides. The
priests and politicians, in former times, were therefore wise in preventing
the first approaches of innovation and inquiry; in preserving
inviolate the smallest link in the adamantine chain with which they
had bound the bodies and the souls of men; in closing up every avenue
or pore through which a doubt could creep in; for they knew that
through the slightest crevice floods of irreligion and heresy would
break in like a tide. Hence the constant alarm at free discussion and
inquiry; hence the clamour against innovation and reform; hence
our dread and detestation of those who differ with us in opinion, for
this at once puts us on the necessity of defending ourselves, or of
owning ourselves weak or in the wrong, if we cannot, and converts
that which was before a bed of roses, while we slept undisturbed
upon it, into a cushion of thorns; and hence our natural tenaciousness
of those points which are most vulnerable, and of which we have no
proof to offer; for, as reason fails us, we are more annoyed by the
objections and require to be soothed and supported by the concurrence
of others. Bigotry and intolerance, which pass as synonymous, are,
if rightly considered, a contradiction in terms; for, if in drawing up
the articles of our creed, we are blindly bigoted to our impressions
and views, utterly disregarding all others, why should we afterwards
be so haunted and disturbed by the last, as to wish to exterminate
every difference of sentiment with fire and sword? The difficulty is
only solved by considering that unequal compound, the human mind,
alternately swayed by individual biasses and abstract pretensions, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>where reason so often panders to, or is made the puppet of, the will.
To show at once the danger and extent of prejudice, it may be
sufficient to observe that all our convictions, however arrived at, and
whether founded on strict demonstration or the merest delusion, are
crusted over with the same varnish of confidence and conceit, and
afford the same firm footing both to our theories and practice; or if
there be any difference, we are in general ‘most ignorant of what we
are most assured,’ the strength of will and impatience of contradiction
making up for the want of evidence. Mr. Burke says, that we ought
to ‘cherish our prejudices because they are prejudices;’ but this
view of the case will satisfy the demands of neither party, for prejudice
is never easy unless it can pass itself off for reason, or abstract
undeniable truth: and again, in the eye of reason, if all prejudices are
to be equally respected as such, then the prejudices of others are right,
and ours must in their turn be wrong. The great stumbling-block to
candour and liberality is the difficulty of being fully possessed of the
excellence of any opinion or pursuits of our own, without proportionably
condemning whatever is opposed to it; nor can we admit the
possibility that when our side of the shield is black, the other should
be white. The largest part of our judgments is prompted by habit
and passion; but because habit is like a second nature, and we
necessarily approve what passion suggests, we will have it that they
are founded entirely on reason and nature, and that all the world must
be of the same opinion, unless they wilfully shut their eyes to the
truth. Animals are free from prejudice, because they have no notion
or care about anything beyond themselves, and have no wish to
generalise or talk big on what does not concern them: man alone
falls into absurdity and error by setting up a claim to superior wisdom
and virtue, and to be a dictator and lawgiver to all around him, and
on all things that he has the remotest conception of. If mere prejudice
were dumb, as well as deaf and blind, it would not so much
signify; but as it is, each sect, age, country, profession, individual, is
ready to prove that they are exclusively in the right, and to go
together by the ears for it. ‘Rings the earth with the vain stir?’
It is the trick for each party to raise an outcry against prejudice; as
by this they flatter themselves, and would have it supposed by others,
that they are perfectly free from it, and have all the reason on their
own side. It is easy indeed, to call names, or to separate the word
<em>prejudice</em> from the word <em>reason</em>; but not so easy to separate the two
things. Reason seems a very positive and palpable thing to those
who have no notion of it but as expressing their own views and
feelings; as prejudice is evidently a very gross and shocking absurdity
(that no one can fall into who wishes to avoid it), as long as we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>continue to apply this term to the prejudices of other people. To
suppose that we cannot make a mistake is the very way to run headlong
into it; for, if the distinction were so broad and glaring as our
self-conceit and dogmatism lead us to imagine it is, we could never,
but by design, mistake truth for falsehood. Those, however, who
think they can <em>make a clear stage of it</em>, and frame a set of opinions on
all subjects by an appeal to reason alone, and without the smallest
intermixture of custom, imagination, or passion, know just as little of
themselves as they do of human nature. The best way to prevent
our running into the wildest excesses of prejudice and the most
dangerous aberrations from reason, is, not to represent the two things
as having a great gulph between them, which it is impossible to pass
without a violent effort, but to show that we are constantly (even
when we think ourselves most secure) treading on the brink of
a precipice; that custom, passion, imagination, insinuate themselves
into and influence almost every judgment we pass or sentiment
we indulge, and are a necessary help (as well as hindrance) to
the human understanding; and that, to attempt to refer every question
to abstract truth and precise definition, without allowing for the
frailty of prejudice, which is the unavoidable consequence of the
frailty and imperfection of reason, would be to unravel the whole web
and texture of human understanding and society. Such daring
anatomists of morals and philosophy think that the whole beauty of
the mind consists in the skeleton; cut away, without remorse, all
sentiment, fancy, taste, as superfluous excrescences; and, in their own
eager, unfeeling pursuit of scientific truth and elementary principles,
they ‘murder to dissect.’ But of this I may say something in
another paper.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is a mistake, however, to suppose that all prejudices are false,
though it is not an easy matter to distinguish between true and false
prejudice. Prejudice is properly an opinion or feeling, not for which
there is no reason, but of which we cannot render a satisfactory
account on the spot. It is not always possible to assign a ‘reason
for the faith that is in us,’ not even if we take time and summon up
all our strength; but it does not therefore follow that our faith is
hollow and unfounded. A false impression may be defined to be an
effect without a cause, or without any adequate one; but the effect
may remain and be true, though the cause is concealed or forgotten.
The grounds of our opinions and tastes may be deep, and be scattered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>over a large surface; they may be various, remote and complicated,
but the result will be sound and true, if they have existed at all,
though we may not be able to analyse them into classes, or to recall
the particular time, place, and circumstances of each individual case
or branch of the evidence. The materials of thought and feeling, the
body of facts and experience, are infinite, are constantly going on
around us, and acting to produce an impression of good or evil, of
assent or dissent to certain inferences; but to require that we should
be prepared to retain the whole of this mass of experience in our
memory, to resolve it into its component parts, and be able to quote
chapter and verse for every conclusion we unavoidably draw from it,
or else to discard the whole together as unworthy the attention of a
rational being, is to betray an utter ignorance both of the limits and
the several uses of the human capacity. The <em>feeling</em> of the truth of
anything, or the soundness of the judgment formed upon it from
repeated, actual impressions, is one thing: the power of vindicating
and enforcing it, by distinctly appealing to or explaining those
impressions, is another. The most fluent talkers or most plausible
reasoners are not always the justest thinkers.</p>

<p class='c007'>To deny that we can, in a certain sense, know and be justified in
believing anything of which we cannot give the complete demonstration,
or the exact <em>why</em> and <em>how</em>, would only be to deny that the
clown, the mechanic (and not even the greatest philosopher), can
know the commonest thing; for in this new and dogmatical process
of reasoning, the greatest philosopher can trace nothing <em>above</em>, nor
proceed a single step without taking something for granted;<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c008'><sup>[60]</sup></a> and it
is well if he does not take more things for granted than the most
vulgar and illiterate, and what he knows a great deal less about. A
common mechanic can tell how to work an engine better than the
mathematician who invented it. A peasant is able to foretell rain
from the appearance of the clouds, because (time out of mind) he has
seen that appearance followed by that consequence; and shall a
pedant catechise him out of a conviction which he has found true in
innumerable instances, because he does not understand the composition
of the elements, or cannot put his notions into a logical shape?
There may also be some collateral circumstance (as the time of day),
as well as the appearance of the clouds, which he may forget to state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>in accounting for his prediction; though, as it has been a part of his
familiar experience, it has naturally guided him in forming it, whether
he was aware of it or not. This comes under the head of the well-known
principle of the <em>association of ideas</em>; by which certain impressions,
from frequent recurrence, coalesce and act in unison truly and
mechanically—that is, without our being conscious of anything but
the general and settled result. On this principle it has been well
said, that ‘there is nothing so true as habit;’ but it is also blind:
we feel and can produce a given effect from numberless repetitions of
the same cause; but we neither inquire into the cause, nor advert to
the mode. In learning any art or exercise, we are obliged to take
lessons, to watch others, to proceed step by step, to attend to the
details and means employed; but when we are masters of it, we take
all this for granted, and do it without labour and without thought, by
a kind of habitual instinct—that is, by the trains of our ideas and
volitions having been directed uniformly, and at last flowing of themselves
into the proper channel.</p>

<p class='c007'>We never do anything well till we cease to think about the manner
of doing it. This is the reason why it is so difficult for any but
natives to speak a language correctly or idiomatically. They do not
succeed in this from knowledge or reflection, but from inveterate
custom, which is a cord that cannot be loosed. In fact, in all that
we do, feel, or think, there is a leaven of <em>prejudice</em> (more or less
extensive), viz. something implied, of which we do not know or have
forgotten the grounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>If I am required to prove the possibility, or demonstrate the mode
of whatever I do before I attempt it, I can neither speak, walk, nor
see; nor have the use of my hands, senses, or common understanding.
I do not know what muscles I use in walking, nor what organs
I employ in speech: those who do, cannot speak or walk better on
that account; nor can they tell how these organs and muscles themselves
act. Can I not discover that one object is near, and another
at a distance, from the <em>eye</em> alone, or from continual impressions of
sense and custom concurring to make the distinction, without going
through a course of perspective and optics?—or am I not to be
allowed an opinion on the subject, or to act upon it, without being
accused of being a very <em>prejudiced</em> and obstinate person? An artist
knows that, to imitate an object in the horizon, he must use less
colour; and the naturalist knows that this effect is produced by the
intervention of a greater quantity of air: but a country fellow, who
knows nothing of either circumstance, must not only be ignorant but
a blockhead, if he could be persuaded that a hill ten miles off was
close before him, only because he could not state the grounds of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>opinion scientifically. Not only must we (if restricted to reason and
philosophy) distrust the notices of sense, but we must also dismiss all
that mass of knowledge and perception which falls under the head of
<em>common sense</em> and <em>natural feeling</em>, which is made up of the strong and
urgent, but undefined impressions of things upon us, and lies between
the two extremes of absolute proof and the grossest ignorance.
Many of these pass for instinctive principles and <em>innate ideas</em>; but
there is nothing in them ‘more than natural.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Without the aid of prejudice and custom, I should not be able to
find my way across the room; nor know how to conduct myself in
any circumstances, nor what to feel in any relation of life. Reason
may play the critic, and correct certain errors afterwards; but if we
were to wait for its formal and absolute decisions in the shifting and
multifarious combinations of human affairs, the world would stand
still. Even men of science, after they have gone over the proofs a
number of times, abridge the process, and <em>jump at a conclusion</em>: is it
therefore false, because they have always found it to be true?
Science after a certain time becomes presumption; and learning
reposes in ignorance. It has been observed, that women have more
<em>tact</em> and insight into character than men, that they find out a pedant,
a pretender, a blockhead, sooner. The explanation is, that they
trust more to the first impressions and natural indications of things,
without troubling themselves with a learned theory of them; whereas
men, affecting greater gravity, and thinking themselves bound to
justify their opinions, are afraid to form any judgment at all, without
the formality of proofs and definitions, and blunt the edge of their
understandings, lest they should commit some mistake. They stay
for facts, till it is too late to pronounce on the characters. Women
are naturally physiognomists, and men phrenologists. The first judge
by sensations; the last by rules. Prejudice is so far then an involuntary
and stubborn <em>association of ideas</em>, of which we cannot assign the
distinct grounds and origin; and the answer to the question, ‘How
do we know whether the prejudice is true or false?’ depends chiefly
on that other, whether the first connection between our ideas has
been real or imaginary. This again resolves into the inquiry—Whether
the subject in dispute falls under the province of our own
experience, feeling, and observation, or is referable to the head of
authority, tradition, and fanciful conjecture? Our practical conclusions
are in this respect generally right; our speculative opinions are
just as likely to be wrong. What we derive from our personal
acquaintance with things (however narrow in its scope or imperfectly
digested), is, for the most part, built on a solid foundation—that of
Nature; it is in trusting to others (who give themselves out for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>guides and doctors) that we are <em>all abroad</em>, and at the mercy of
quackery, impudence, and imposture. Any impression, however
absurd, or however we may have imbibed it, by being repeated and
indulged in, becomes an article of implicit and incorrigible belief.
The point to consider is, how we have first taken it up, whether
from ourselves or the arbitrary dictation of others. ‘Thus shall we
try the doctrines, whether they be of nature or of man.’</p>

<p class='c007'>So far then from the charge lying against vulgar and illiterate
prejudice as the bane of truth and common sense, the argument turns
the other way; for the greatest, the most solemn, and mischievous
absurdities that mankind have been the dupes of, they have imbibed
from the dogmatism and vanity or hypocrisy of the self-styled wise
and learned, who have imposed profitable fictions upon them for self-evident
truths, and contrived to enlarge their power with their pretensions
to knowledge. Every boor sees that the sun shines above
his head; that ‘the moon is made of green cheese,’ is a fable that has
been taught him. Defoe says, that there were a hundred thousand
stout country-fellows in his time ready to fight to the death against
popery, without knowing whether popery was a man or a horse.
This, then, was a prejudice that they did not fill up of their own heads.
All the great points that men have founded a claim to superiority,
wisdom, and illumination upon, that they have embroiled the world
with, and made matters of the last importance, are what one age and
country differ diametrically with each other about, have been successively
and justly exploded, and have been the levers of opinion and
the grounds of contention, precisely because, as their expounders and
believers are equally in the dark about them, they rest wholly on the
fluctuations of will and passion, and as they can neither be proved nor
disproved, admit of the fiercest opposition or the most bigoted faith.
In what ‘comes home to the business and bosoms of men,’ there is
less of this uncertainty and presumption; and there, in the little
world of our own knowledge and experience, we can hardly do
better than attend to the ‘still, small voice’ of our own hearts and
feelings, instead of being browbeat by the effrontery, or puzzled by
the sneers and cavils of pedants and sophists, of whatever school or
description.</p>

<p class='c007'>If I take a prejudice against a person from his face, I shall very
probably be in the right; if I take a prejudice against a person from
hearsay, I shall quite as probably be in the wrong. We have a prejudice
in favour of certain books, but it is hardly without knowledge,
if we have read them with delight over and over again. Fame itself
is a prejudice, though a fine one. Natural affection is a prejudice:
for though we have cause to love our nearest connections better than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>others, we have no reason to think them better than others. The
error here is, when that which is properly a dictate of the heart passes
out of its sphere, and becomes an overweening decision of the understanding.
So in like manner of the love of country; and there is a
prejudice in favour of virtue, genius, liberty, which (though it were
possible) it would be a pity to destroy. The passions, such as
avarice, ambition, love, &#38;c., are prejudices, that is amply exaggerated
views of certain objects, made up of habit and imagination beyond
their real value; but if we ask what is the real value of any object,
independently of its connection with the power of habit, or its
affording natural scope for the imagination, we shall perhaps be
puzzled for an answer. To reduce things to the scale of abstract
reason would be to annihilate our interest in them, instead of raising
our affections to a higher standard; and by striving to make man
rational, we should leave him merely brutish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Animals are without prejudice: they are not led away by authority
or custom, but it is because they are gross, and incapable of being
taught. It is, however, a mistake to imagine that only the vulgar
and ignorant, who can give no account of their opinions, are the
slaves of bigotry and prejudice; the noisiest declaimers, the most
subtle casuists, and most irrefragable doctors, are as far removed from
the character of true philosophers, while they strain and pervert all
their powers to prove some unintelligible dogma, instilled into their
minds by early education, interest, or self-importance; and if we say
the peasant or artisan is a Mahometan because he is born in Turkey,
or a papist because he is born in Italy, the mufti at Constantinople or
the cardinal at Rome is so, for no better reason, in the midst of all
his pride and learning. Mr. Hobbes used to say, that if he had read
as much as others, he should have been as ignorant as they.</p>

<p class='c007'>After all, most of our opinions are a mixture of reason and prejudice,
experience and authority. We can only judge for ourselves
in what concerns ourselves, and in things about us: and even there
we must trust continually to established opinion and current report;
in higher and more abstruse points we must pin our faith still more
on others. If we believe only what we know at first hand, without
trusting to authority at all, we shall disbelieve a great many things
that really exist; and the suspicious coxcomb is as void of judgment
as the credulous fool. My habitual conviction of the existence
of such a place as Rome is not strengthened by my having
seen it; it might be almost said to be obscured and weakened, as the
reality falls short of the imagination. I walk along the streets without
fearing that the houses will fall on my head, though I have not examined
their foundation; and I believe firmly in the Newtonian system,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>though I have never read the <cite>Principia</cite>. In the former case, I argue
that if the houses were inclined to fall they would not wait for me;
and in the latter I acquiesce in what all who have studied the subject,
and are capable of understanding it, agree in, having no reason to
suspect the contrary. That <em>the earth turns round</em> is agreeable to my
understanding, though it shocks my sense, which is however too weak
to grapple with so vast a question.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>ON PARTY SPIRIT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='left'><cite>The Atlas.</cite>]</span>      <span class='right'>[<em>April 25, 1830.</em></span></p>

<p class='c006'>Party spirit is one of the <em>profoundnesses of Satan</em>, or in more modern
language, one of the dexterous <em>equivoques</em> and contrivances of our self-love,
to prove that we, and those who agree with us, combine all that
is excellent and praiseworthy in our own persons (as in a ring-fence)
and that all the vices and deformity of human nature take refuge
with those who differ from us. It is extending and fortifying
the principle of the <em>amour-propre</em>, by calling to its aid the <em>esprit de
corps</em> and screening and surrounding our favourite propensities and
obstinate caprices in the hollow squares or dense phalanxes of sects
and parties. This is a happy mode of pampering our self-complacency,
and persuading ourselves that we and those that side with us, are
‘the salt of the earth;’ of giving vent to the morbid humours of
our pride, envy, and all uncharitableness, those natural secretions
of the human heart, under the pretext of self-defence, the public
safety, or a voice from Heaven, as it may happen; and of heaping
every excellence into one scale, and throwing all the obloquy and
contempt into the other, in virtue of a nickname, a watch-word of
party, a badge, the colour of a ribbon, the cut of a dress. We thus
desolate the globe, or tear a country in pieces, to show that we are
the only people fit to live in it; and fancy ourselves angels, while we
are playing the devil. In this manner, the Huron devours the Iroquois,
because he is an Iroquois, and the Iroquois the Huron for a similar
reason; neither suspects that he does it, because he himself is a savage
and no better than a wild beast; and is convinced in his own breast
that the difference of name and tribe makes a total difference in the
case. The Papist persecutes the Protestant, the Protestant persecutes
the Papist in his turn; and each fancies that he has a plenary right to
do so, while he keeps in view only the offensive epithet which ‘cuts
the common link of brotherhood between them.’ The church of
England ill-treated the Dissenters, and the Dissenters, when they had
the opportunity, did not spare the church of England. The Whig
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>calls the Tory a knave, the Tory compliments the Whig with the
same title, and each thinks the abuse sticks to the party-name, and
has nothing to do with himself or the generic name of <em>man</em>. On
the contrary, it cuts both ways; but while the Whig says ‘The Tory
is a knave, because he is a Tory,’ this is as much as to say, ‘I cannot
be a knave, because I am a Whig;’ and by exaggerating the
profligacy of his opponent, he imagines he is laying the sure foundation,
and raising the lofty superstructure of his own praises. But if he
says, which is the truth, ‘The Tory is not a rascal because he is a
Tory, but because human nature in power, and with the temptation, is
a rascal,’ then this would imply that the seeds of depravity are sown
in his own bosom, and might shoot out into full growth and luxuriance
if he got into place, which he does not wish to appear <em>till he does get
into place</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may be intolerant even in advocating the cause of Toleration, and
so bent on making proselytes to Free-thinking as to allow no one to
think freely but ourselves. The most boundless liberality in appearance
may amount in reality to the most monstrous ostracism of opinion—not
in condemning this or that tenet, or standing up for this or that
sect or party, but in assuming a supercilious superiority to all sects and
parties alike, and proscribing in the lump and in one sweeping clause
all arts, sciences, opinions, and pursuits but our own. Till the time
of Locke and Toland a general toleration was never dreamt of: it
was thought right on all hands to punish and discountenance heretics
and schismatics, but each party alternately claimed to be true
Christians and orthodox believers. Daniel Defoe, who spent his
whole life, and wasted his strength in asserting the right of the Dissenters
to a toleration (and got no thanks for it but the pillory), was
scandalized at the proposal of the general principle, and was equally
strenuous in excluding Quakers, Anabaptists, Socinians, Sceptics, and
all who did not agree in the <em>essentials</em> of Christianity, that is, who
did not agree with him, from the benefit of such an indulgence to
tender consciences. We wonder at the cruelties formerly practised
upon the Jews: is there anything wonderful in it? They were at
the time the only people to make a butt and a bugbear of, to set up as
a mark of indignity and as a foil to our self-love, for the <em>feræ naturæ</em>
principle that is within us and always craving its prey to hunt down,
to worry and make sport of at discretion, and without mercy—the
unvarying uniformity and implicit faith of the Catholic church had
imposed silence, and put a curb on our jarring dissensions, heart-burnings,
and ill-blood, so that we had no pretence for quarrelling among
ourselves for the glory of God or the salvation of men:—a <span class='sc'>Jordanus
Bruno</span>, an Atheist or sorcerer, once in a way, would hardly suffice to stay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>the stomach of our theological rancour, we therefore fell with might
and main upon the Jews as a <em>forlorn hope</em> in this dearth of objects of
spite or zeal; or, as the whole of Europe was reconciled in the
bosom of holy mother church, went to the holy land in search of
a difference of opinion and a ground of mortal offence; but no
sooner was there a division of the Christian world than Papist fell
upon Protestant, Protestants upon schismatics, and schismatics upon
one another, with the same loving fury as they had before fallen upon
Turks and Jews. The disposition is always there, like a muzzled
mastiff—the pretext only is wanting; and this is furnished by a name,
which, as soon as it is affixed to different sects or parties, gives us a
license, we think, to let loose upon them all our malevolence, domineering
humour, love of power and wanton mischief, as if they were
of different species. The sentiment of the pious English bishop was
good, who, on seeing a criminal led to execution, exclaimed, ‘There
goes my wicked self!’</p>

<p class='c007'>If we look at common patriotism, it will furnish an illustration of
party-spirit. One would think by an Englishman’s hatred of the
French, and his readiness to die fighting with and for his countrymen,
that all the nation were united as one man in heart and hand—and
so they are in war-time—and as an exercise of their loyalty and
courage; but let the crisis be over, and they cool wonderfully, begin
to feel the distinctions of English, Irish, and Scotch, fall out among
themselves upon some minor distinction; the same hand that was
eager to shed the blood of a Frenchman will not give a crust of
bread or a cup of cold water to a fellow-countryman in distress; and
the heroes who defended the wooden walls of Old England are
left to expose their wounds and crippled limbs to gain a pittance from
the passenger, or to perish of hunger, cold, and neglect in our highways.
Such is the effect of our boasted nationality: it is active,
fierce in doing mischief; dormant, lukewarm in doing good. We
may also see why the greatest stress is laid on trifles in religion, and
why the most violent animosities arise out of the smallest differences
in politics and religion. In the first place, it would never do to
establish our superiority over others by the acquisition of greater
virtues, or by discarding our vices; but it is charming to do this by
merely repeating a different <em>formula</em> of prayer, or turning to the east
instead of the west. He should fight boldly for such a distinction,
who is persuaded it will furnish him with a passport to the other world,
and entitle him to look down on the rest of his fellows as <em>given over
to perdition</em>. Secondly, we often hate those most with whom we have
only a slight shade of difference, whether in politics or religion; because
as the whole in a contest for precedence and infallibility, we find it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>more difficult to draw the line of distinction where so many points
are conceded, and are staggered in our conviction by the arguments of
those whom we cannot despise as totally and incorrigibly in the wrong.
The high-church party in Queen Anne’s time were disposed to sacrifice
the low church and Dissenters to the Papists, because they were more
galled by their arguments and disconcerted with their pretensions. In
private life, the reverse of the foregoing reasoning holds good; that is,
trades and professions present a direct contrast to sects and parties.
A conformity in sentiment strengthens our party and opinion; but those
who have a similarity of pursuit are rivals in interest; and hence the
old maxim, that <em>two of a trade cannot agree</em>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>PROJECT FOR A NEW THEORY OF CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LEGISLATION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When I was about fourteen (as long ago as the year 1792), in
consequence of a dispute, one day after coming out of meeting, between
my father and an old lady of the congregation, respecting the repeal
of the Corporation and Test Acts and the limits of religious toleration,
I set about forming in my head (the first time I ever attempted to
think) the following system of political rights and general jurisprudence.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was this circumstance that decided the fate of my future life;
or rather, I would say it was from an original bias or craving to be
satisfied of the reason of things, that I seized hold of this accidental
opportunity to indulge in its uneasy and unconscious determination.
Mr. Currie, my old tutor at Hackney, may still have the rough
draught of this speculation, which I gave him with tears in my eyes,
and which he good-naturedly accepted in lieu of the customary <em>themes</em>,
and as a proof that I was no idler, but that my inability to produce a
line on the ordinary school topics arose from my being involved in
more difficult and abstruse matters. He must smile at the so oft-repeated
charge against me of florid flippancy and tinsel. If from
those briars I have since plucked roses, what labour has it not cost
me? The Test and Corporation Acts were repealed the other day.
How would my father have rejoiced if this had happened in his time,
and in concert with his old friends Dr. Price, Dr. Priestley, and
others! but now that there is no one to care about it, they give as a
boon to indifference what they so long refused to justice, and thus
ascribed by some to the liberality of the age! Spirit of contradiction!
when wilt thou cease to rule over sublunary affairs, as the moon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>governs the tides? Not till the unexpected stroke of a comet throws
up a new breed of men and animals from the bowels of the earth;
nor then neither, since it is included in the very idea of all life,
power, and motion. <em>For</em> and <em>against</em> are inseparable terms. But not
to wander any farther from the point—</p>

<p class='c007'>I began with trying to define what a <em>right</em> meant; and this I
settled with myself was not simply that which is good or useful in
itself, but that which is thought so by the individual, and which has
the sanction of his will as such. 1. Because the determining what
is good in itself is an endless question. 2. Because one person’s
having a right to any good, and another being made the judge of it,
leaves him without any security for its being exercised to his advantage,
whereas self-love is a natural guarantee for our self-interest. 3. A
thing being willed is the most absolute moral reason for its existence:
that a thing is good in itself is no reason whatever why it should
exist, till the will clothes it with a power to act as a motive; and
there is certainly nothing to prevent this will from taking effect (no
law or admitted plea above it) but another will opposed to it, and
which forms a right on the same principle. A good is only so far a
right, inasmuch as it virtually determines the will; for a <em>right</em> meant
that which contains within itself, and as respects the bosom in which
it is lodged, a cogent and unanswerable reason why it should exist.
Suppose I have a violent aversion to one thing and as strong an attachment
to something else, and that there is no other being in the world
but myself, shall I not have a self-evident right, full title, liberty, to
pursue the one and avoid the other? That is to say, in other words,
there can be no authority to interpose between the strong natural
tendency of the will and its desired effect, but the will of another.
It may be replied that reason, that affection, may interpose between
the will and the act; but there are motives that influence the conduct
by first altering the will; and the point at issue is, that these being
away, what other principle or lever is there always left to appeal to,
before we come to blows? Now, such a principle is to be found in
self-interest; and such a barrier against the violent will is erected by
the limits which this principle necessarily sets to itself in the claims of
different individuals. Thus, then, a right is not that which is right
in itself, or best for the whole, or even for the individual, but that
which is good in his own eyes, and according to his own will; and
to which, among a number of equally selfish and self-willed beings,
he can lay claim, allowing the same latitude and allowance to others.
Political justice is that which assigns the limits of these individual
rights in society, or it is the adjustment of force against force, of will
against will, to prevent worse consequences. In the savage state there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>is nothing but an appeal to brute force, or the right of the strongest;
Politics lays down a rule to curb and measure out the wills of individuals
in equal portions; Morals has a higher standard still, and
ought never to appeal to force in any case whatever. Hence I always
found something wanting in Mr. Godwin’s <em>Enquiry concerning
Political Justice</em> (which I read soon after with great avidity, and
hoped, from its title and its vast reputation, to get entire satisfaction
from it), for he makes no distinction between political justice, which
implies an appeal to force, and moral justice, which implies only an
appeal to reason. It is surely a distinct question, what you can
persuade people to do by argument and fair discussion, and what you
may lawfully compel them to do, when reason and remonstrance fail.
But in Mr. Godwin’s system the ‘omnipotence of reason’ supersedes
the use of law and government, merges the imperfection of the means
in the grandeur of the end, and leaves but one class of ideas or motives,
the highest and the least attainable possible. So promises and oaths
are said to be of no more value than common breath; nor would they,
if every word we uttered was infallible and oracular, as if delivered
from a Tripod. But this is pragmatical, and putting an imaginary
for a real state of things. Again, right and duties, according to
Mr. Godwin, are reciprocal. I could not comprehend this without
an arbitrary definition that took away the meaning. In my sense, a
man might have a right, a discriminating power, to do something,
which others could not deprive him of, without a manifest infraction
of certain rules laid down for the peace and order of society, but
which it might be his duty to waive upon good reasons shown; rights
are seconded by force, duties are things of choice. This is the
import of the words in common speech: why then pass over this
distinction in a work confessedly rhetorical as well as logical, that is,
which laid an equal stress on sound and sense? Right, therefore,
has a personal or selfish reference, as it is founded on the law which
determines a man’s actions in regard to his own being and well-being;
and political justice is that which assigns the limits of these individual
rights on their compatibility or incompatibility with each other in
society. Right, in a word, is the duty which each man owes to
himself; or it is that portion of the general good of which (as being
principally interested) he is made the special judge, and which is put
under his immediate keeping.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next question I asked myself was, what is law and the real
and necessary ground of civil government? The answer to this is
found in the former statement. <em>Law</em> is something to abridge, or,
more properly speaking, to ascertain, the bounds of the original right,
and to coerce the will of individuals in the community. Whence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>then, has the community such a right? It can only arise in self-defence,
or from the necessity of maintaining the equal rights of every
one, and of opposing force to force in case of any violent and
unwarrantable infringement of them. Society consists of a given
number of individuals; and the aggregate right of government is only
the consequence of these inherent rights, balancing and neutralising
one another. How those who deny natural rights get at any sort of
right, divine or human, I am at a loss to discover; for whatever
exists in combination, exists beforehand in an elementary state. The
world is composed of atoms, and a machine cannot be made without
materials. First, then, it follows that law or government is not the
mere creature of a social compact, since each person has a certain
right which he is bound to defend against another without asking that
other’s leave, or else the right would always be at the mercy of
whoever chose to invade it. There would be a right to do wrong,
but none to resist it. Thus I have a natural right to defend my life
against a murderer, without any mutual compact between us; hence
society has an aggregate right of the same kind, and to make a law to
that effect, forbidding and punishing murder. If there be no such
immediate value and attachment to life felt by the individual, and a
consequent justifiable determination to defend it, then the formal
pretension of society to vindicate a right, which, according to this
reasoning, has no existence in itself, must be founded on air, on a
word, or a lawyer’s <em>ipse dixit</em>. Secondly, society, or government, as
such, has no right to trench upon the liberty or rights of the individuals
its members, except as these last are, as it were, forfeited by interfering
with and destroying one another, like opposite mechanical forces or
quantities in arithmetic. Put the basis that each man’s will is a
sovereign law to itself: this can only hold in society as long as he
does not meddle with others; but as long as he does not do this, the
first principle retains its force, for there is no other principle to
impeach or overrule it. The will of society is not a sufficient plea;
since this is, or ought to be, made up of the wills or rights of the
individuals composing it, which by the supposition remain entire, and
consequently without power to act. The good of society is not a
sufficient plea, for individuals are only bound (on compulsion) not to
do it harm, or to be barely just: benevolence and virtue are voluntary
qualities. For instance, if two persons are obliged to do all that is
possible for the good of both, this must either be settled voluntarily
between them, and then it is friendship, and not force; or if this is
not the case, it is plain that one must be the slave, and lie at the
caprice and mercy of the other: it will be one will forcibly regulating
two bodies. But if each is left master of his own person and actions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>with only the implied proviso of not encroaching on those of the
other, then both may continue free and independent, and contented in
their several spheres. One individual has no right to interfere with
the employment of my muscular powers, or to put violence on my
person, to force me to contribute to the most laudable undertaking if
I do not approve of it, any more than I have to force him to assist
me in the direct contrary: if one has not, ten have not, nor a million,
any such arbitrary right over me. What one can be <em>made</em> to do for a
million is very trifling: what a million may do by being left free in
all that merely concerns themselves, and not subject to the perpetual
caprice and insolence of authority, and pretext of the public good, is
a very different calculation. By giving up the principle of political
independence, it is not the million that will govern the one, but the
one that will in time give law to the million. There are some things
that cannot be free in natural society, and against which there is a
natural law; for instance, no one can be allowed to knock out
another’s brains or to fetter his limbs with impunity. And government
is bound to prevent the same violations of liberty and justice.
The question is, whether it would not be possible for a government to
exist, and for a system of laws to be framed, that confined itself to
the punishment of such offences, and left all the rest (except the
suppression of force by force) optional or matter of mutual compact.
What are a man’s natural rights? Those, the infringement of which
cannot on any supposition go unpunished: by leaving all but cases of
necessity to choice and reason, much would be perhaps gained, and
nothing lost.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Corollary 1.</span> It results from the foregoing statement, that there
is nothing naturally to restrain or oppose the will of one man, but the
will of another meeting it. Thus, in a desert island, it is evident
that my will and rights would be absolute and unlimited, and I might
say with Robinson Crusoe, ‘I am monarch of all I survey.’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Corollary 2.</span> It is coming into society that circumscribes my
will and rights, by establishing equal and mutual rights, instead of the
original uncircumscribed ones. They are still ‘founded as the rock,’
though not so broad and general as the casing air, for the only thing
that limits them is the solidity of another right, no better than my
own, and, like stones in a building, or a mosaic pavement, each
remains not the less firmly riveted to its place, though it cannot
encroach upon the next to it. I do not belong to the state, nor am I
a nonentity in it, but I am one part of it, and independent in it, for
that very reason that every one in it is independent of me. Equality,
instead of being destroyed by society, results from and is improved by
it; for in politics, as in physics, the action and reaction are the same:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>the right of resistance on their part implies the right of self-defence
on mine. In a theatre, each person has a right to his own seat, by
the supposition that he has no right to intrude into any one else’s.
They are convertible propositions. Away, then, with the notion that
liberty and equality are inconsistent. But here is the artifice: by
merging the rights and independence of the individual in the fictitious
order of society, those rights become arbitrary, capricious, equivocal,
removable at the pleasure of the state or ruling power; there is
nothing substantial or durable implied in them: if each has no positive
claim, naturally, those of all taken together can mount up to nothing;
right and justice are mere blanks to be filled up with arbitrary will,
and the people have thenceforward no defence against the government.
On the other hand, suppose these rights to be not empty names or
artificial arrangements, but original and inherent like solid atoms, then
it is not in the power of government to annihilate one of them, whatever
may be the confusion arising from their struggle for mastery, or
before they can settle into order and harmony. Mr. Burke talks of
the reflections and refractions of the rays of light as altering their
primary essence and direction. But if there were no original rays of
light, there could be neither refraction, nor reflections. Why, then,
does he try by cloudy sophistry to blot the sun out of heaven? One
body impinges against and impedes another in the fall, but it could
not do this, but for the principle of gravity. The author of the
<em>Sublime and Beautiful</em> would have a single atom outweigh the great
globe itself; or an empty title, a bloated privilege, or a grievous
wrong overturn the entire mass of truth and justice. The question
between the author and his opponents appears to be simply this:
whether politics, or the general good, is an affair of reason or
imagination! and this seems decided by another consideration, viz.,
that Imagination is the judge of individual things, and Reason of
generals. Hence the great importance of the principle of universal
suffrage; for if the vote and choice of a single individual goes for
nothing, so, by parity of reasoning, may that of all the rest of the
community: but if the choice of every man in the community is held
sacred, then what must be the weight and value of the whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many persons object that by this means property is not represented,
and so, to avoid that, they would have nothing but property represented,
at the same time that they pretend that if the elective franchise
were thrown open to the poor, they would be wholly at the command
of the rich, to the prejudice and exclusion of the middle and independent
classes of society. Property always has a natural influence
and authority; it is only people without property that have no natural
protection, and require every artificial and legal one. <em>Those that have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>much, shall have none; and those that have little, shall have less.</em> This
proverb is no less true in public than in private life. The <em>better orders</em>
(as they are called, and who, in virtue of this title, would assume a
monopoly in the direction of state affairs) are merely and in plain
English those who are <em>better off</em> than others; and as they get the
wished-for monopoly into their hands, others will be uniformly <em>worse
off</em>, and will sink lower and lower in the scale; so that it is essentially
requisite to extend the elective franchise in order to counteract the
excess of the great and increasing goodness of the better orders to
themselves. I see no reason to suppose that in any case popular
feeling (if free course were given to it) would bear down public
opinion. Literature is at present pretty nearly on the footing of
universal suffrage, yet the public defer sufficiently to the critics; and
when no party bias interferes, and the government do not make a
point of running a writer down, the verdict is tolerably fair and just.
I do not say that the result might not be equally satisfactory, when
literature was patronised more immediately by the great; but then
lords and ladies had no interest in praising a bad piece and condemning
a good one. If they could have laid a tax on the town for not going
to it, they would have run a bad play forty nights together, or the
whole year round, without scruple. As things stand, the worse the
law, the better for the lawmakers: it takes everything from others to
give it to <em>them</em>. It is common to insist on universal suffrage and the
ballot together. But if the first were allowed, the second would be
unnecessary. The ballot is only useful as a screen from arbitrary
power. There is nothing manly or independent to recommend it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Corollary 3.</span> If I was out at sea in a boat with a <em>jure divino</em>
monarch, and he wanted to throw me overboard, I would not let him.
No gentleman would ask such a thing, no freeman would submit to it.
Has he, then, a right to dispose of the lives and liberties of thirty
millions of men? Or have they more right than I have to resist his
demands? They have thirty millions of times that right, if they had
a particle of the same spirit that I have. It is not the individual,
then, whom in this case I fear (to me ‘there’s <em>no</em> divinity doth hedge
a king’), but thirty millions of his subjects that call me to account in
his name, and who are of a most approved and indisputable loyalty,
and who have both the right and power. The power rests with the
multitude, but let them beware how the exercise of it turns against
their own rights! It is not the idol but the worshippers that are to
be dreaded, and who, by degrading one of their fellows, render themselves
liable to be branded with the same indignities.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Corollary 4.</span> No one can be born a slave; for my limbs are my
own, and the power and the will to use them are anterior to all laws,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>and independent of the control of every other person. No one
acquires a right over another but that other acquires some reciprocal
right over him; therefore the relation of master and slave is a contradiction
in political logic. Hence, also, it follows that combinations
among labourers for the rise of wages are always just and lawful, as
much as those among master manufacturers to keep them down. A
man’s labour is his own, at least as much as another’s goods; and he
may starve if he pleases, but he may refuse to work except on his
own terms. The right of property is reducible to this simple principle,
that one man has not a right to the produce of another’s labour, but
each man has a right to the benefit of his own exertions and the use
of his natural and inalienable powers, unless for a supposed equivalent
and by mutual consent. Personal liberty and property therefore rest
upon the same foundation. I am glad to see that Mr. Macculloch,
in his <em>Essay on Wages</em>, admits the right of combination among
journeymen and others. I laboured this point hard, and, I think,
satisfactorily, a good while ago, in my <em>Reply to Mr. Malthus</em>.
‘Throw your bread upon the waters, and after many days you shall
find it again.’</p>

<p class='c007'>There are four things that a man may especially call his own. 1.
His person. 2. His actions. 3. His property. 4. His opinions.
Let us see how each of these claims unavoidably circumscribes and
modifies those of others, on the principle of abstract equity and
necessity and independence above laid down.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>First, as to the Rights of Persons.</span> My intention is to show
that the right of society to make laws to coerce the will of others, is
founded on the necessity of repelling the wanton encroachment of that
will on their rights; that is, strictly on the right of self-defence or
resistance to aggression. Society comes forward and says, ‘Let us
alone, and we will let you alone, otherwise we must see which is
strongest;’ its object is not to patronise or advise individuals for
their good, and against their will, but to protect itself: meddling with
others forcibly on any other plea or for any other purpose is impertinence.
But equal rights destroy one another; nor can there be
a right to impossible or impracticable things. Let A, B, C, D, &#38;c.,
be different component parts of any society, each claiming to be the
centre and master of a certain sphere of activity and self-determination:
as long as each keeps within his own line of demarcation there is no
harm done, nor any penalty incurred—it is only the superfluous and
overbearing will of particular persons that must be restrained or lopped
off by the axe of the law. Let A be the culprit; B, C, D, &#38;c., or
the rest of the community, are plaintiffs against A, and wish to
prevent his taking any unfair or unwarranted advantage over them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>They set up no pretence to dictate or domineer over him, but merely
to hinder his dictating to and domineering over them; and in this,
having both might and right on their side, they have no difficulty in
putting it in execution. Every man’s independence and discretionary
power over what peculiarly and exclusively concerns himself, is his
<em>castle</em> (whether round, square, or, according to Mr. Owen’s new map
of improvements, in the form of a parallelogram). As long as he
keeps within this, he is safe—society has no hold of him: it is when
he quits it to attack his neighbours that they resort to reprisals, and
make short work of the interloper. It is, however, time to endeavour
to point out in what this natural division of right, and separate advantage
consists. In the first place, A, B, C, D have the common and
natural rights of persons, in so far that none of these has a right to
offer violence to, or cause bodily pain or injury to any of the others.
Sophists laugh at natural rights: they might as well deny that we
have natural persons; for while the last distinction holds true and
good by the constitution of things, certain consequences must and will
follow from it—‘while this machine is to us Hamlet,’ &#38;c. For
instance, I should like to know whether Mr. Burke, with his <em>Sublime
and Beautiful</em> fancies, would deny that each person has a particular
body and senses belonging to him, so that he feels a peculiar and
natural interest in whatever affects these more than another can, and
whether such a peculiar and paramount interest does not imply a direct
and unavoidable right in maintaining this circle of individuality inviolate.
To argue otherwise is to assert that indifference, or that which
does not feel either the good or the ill, is as capable a judge and
zealous a discriminator of right and wrong as that which does. The
right, then, is coeval and co-extended with the interest, not a product
of convention, but inseparable from the order of the universe; the
doctrine itself is natural and solid; it is the contrary fallacy that is
made of air and words. Mr. Burke, in such a question, was like a
man out at sea in a haze, and could never tell the difference between
land and clouds. If another break my arm by violence, this will not
certainly give him additional health or strength; if he stun me by a
blow or inflict torture on my limbs, it is I who feel the pain, and not
he; and it is hard if I, who am the sufferer, am not allowed to be
the judge. That another should pretend to deprive me of it, or
pretend to judge for me, and set up his will against mine, in what
concerns this portion of my existence—where I have all at stake and
he nothing—is not merely injustice but impudence. The circle of
personal security and right, then, is not an imaginary and arbitrary
line fixed by law and the will of the prince, or the scaly finger of
Mr. Hobbes’s <em>Leviathan</em>, but is real and inherent in the nature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>things, and itself the foundation of law and justice. ‘Hands off is
fair play’—according to the old adage. One, therefore, has not a
right to lay violent hands on another, or to infringe on the sphere of
his personal identity; one must not run foul of another, or he is liable
to be repelled and punished for the offence. If you meet an Englishman
suddenly in the street, he will run up against you sooner than get
out of your way, which last he thinks a compromise of his dignity and
a relinquishment of his purpose, though he expects you to get out of
his. A Frenchman in the same circumstances will come up close to
you, and try to walk over you, as if there was no one in his way; but
if you take no notice of him, he will step on one side, and make you
a low bow. The one is a fellow of stubborn will, the other a <em>petit
maître</em>. An Englishman at a play mounts upon a bench, and refuses
to get down at the request of another, who threatens to call him to
account the next day. ‘Yes,’ is the answer of the first, ‘if your
master will let you!’ His abuse of liberty, he thinks, is justified by
the other’s want of it. All an Englishman’s ideas are modifications
of his will; which shows, in one way, that right is founded on will,
since the English are at once the freest and most wilful of all people.
If you meet another on the ridge of a precipice, are you to throw
each other down? Certainly not. You are to pass as well as you
can. ‘Give and take,’ is the rule of natural right, where the right is
not all on one side and cannot be claimed entire. Equal weights and
scales produce a balance, as much as where the scales are empty: so
it does not follow (as our votaries of absolute power would insinuate)
that one man’s right is nothing because another’s is something. But
suppose there is not time to pass, and one or other must perish, in the
case just mentioned, then each must do the best for himself that he
can, and the instinct of self-preservation prevails over everything else.
In the streets of London, the passengers take the right hand of one
another and the wall alternately; he who should not conform to this
rule would be guilty of a breach of the peace. But if a house were
falling, or a mad ox driven furiously by, the rule would be, of course,
suspended, because the case would be out of the ordinary. Yet I
think I can conceive, and have even known, persons capable of carrying
the point of gallantry in political right to such a pitch as to refuse
to take a precedence which did not belong to them in the most
perilous circumstances, just as a soldier may waive a right to quit his
post, and takes his turn in battle. The actual collision or case of
personal assault and battery, is, then, clearly prohibited, inasmuch as
each person’s body is clearly defined: but how if A use other means
of annoyance against B, such as a sword or poison, or resort to what
causes other painful sensations besides tangible ones, for instance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>certain disagreeable sounds and smells? Or, if these are included as
a violation of personal rights, then how draw the line between them
and the employing certain offensive words and gestures or uttering
opinions which I disapprove? This is a puzzler for the dogmatic
school; but they solve the whole difficulty by an assumption of <em>utility</em>,
which is as much as to tell a person that the way to any place to
which he asks a direction is ‘to follow his nose.’ We want to know
by given marks and rules what is best and useful; and they assure us
very wisely, that this is infallibly and clearly determined by what is
best and useful. Let us try something else. It seems no less
necessary to erect certain little <em>fortalices</em>, with palisades and outworks
about them, for <span class='sc'>Right</span> to establish and maintain itself in, than as
landmarks to guide us across the wide waste of <span class='sc'>Utility</span>. If a person
runs a sword through me, or administers poison, or procures it to be
administered, the effect, the pain, disease or death is the same, and I
have the same right to prevent it, on the principle that I am the
sufferer; that the injury is offered to me, and he is no gainer by it,
except for mere malice or caprice, and I therefore remain master and
judge of my own remedy, as in the former case; the principle and
definition of right being to secure to each individual the determination
and protection of that portion of sensation in which he has the
greatest, if not a sole interest, and, as it were, identity with it. Again,
as to what are called <em>nuisances</em>, to wit offensive smells, sounds, &#38;c., it
is more difficult to determine on the ground that <em>one man’s meat is
another man’s poison</em>. I remember a case occurred in the neighbourhood
where I was, and at the time I was trying my best at this
question, which puzzled me a good deal. A rector of a little town
in Shropshire, who was at variance with all his parishioners, had conceived
a particular spite to a lawyer who lived next door to him, and
as a means of annoying him, used to get together all sorts of rubbish,
weeds, and unsavoury materials, and set them on fire, so that the
smoke should blow over into his neighbour’s garden; whenever the
wind set in that direction, he said, as a signal to his gardener,’It’s a
fine Wicksteed wind to-day;’ and the operation commenced. Was
this an action of assault and battery, or not? I think it was, for this
reason, that the offence was unequivocal, and that the only motive for
the proceeding was the giving this offence. The assailant would not
like to be served so himself. Mr. Bentham would say, the malice of
the motive was a set-off to the injury. I shall leave that <em>prima
philosophia</em> consideration out of the question. A man who knocks out
another’s brains with a bludgeon may say it pleases him to do so;
but will it please him to have the compliment returned? If he still
persists, in spite of this punishment, there is no preventing him; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>if not, then it is a proof that he thinks the pleasure less than the pain
to himself, and consequently to another in the scales of justice. The
<em>lex talionis</em> is an excellent test. Suppose a third person (the physician
of the place) had said, ‘It is a fine Egerton wind to-day,’ our rector
would have been non-plussed; for he would have found that, as he
suffered all the hardship, he had the right to complain of and to resist
an action of another, the consequences of which affected principally
himself. Now mark: if he had himself had any advantage to derive
from the action, which he could not obtain in any other way, then he
would feel that his neighbour also had the same plea and right to
follow his own course (still this might be a doubtful point);
but in the other case it would be sheer malice and wanton interference;
that is, not the exercise of a right, but the invasion of
another’s comfort and independence. Has a person, then, a right to
play on the horn or on a flute, on the same staircase? I say, yes;
because it is for his own improvement and pleasure, and not to annoy
another; and because, accordingly, every one in his own case would
wish to reserve this or a similar privilege to himself. I do not think
a person has a right to beat a drum under one’s window, because this
is altogether disagreeable, and if there is any extraordinary motive for
it, then it is fit that the person should be put to some little inconvenience
in removing his sphere of liberty of action to a reasonable
distance. A tallow-chandler’s shop or a steam-engine is a nuisance
in a town, and ought to be removed into the suburbs; but they are to
be tolerated where they are least inconvenient, because they are
necessary somewhere, and there is no remedying the inconvenience.
The right to protest against and to prohibit them rests with the
suffering party; but because this point of the greatest interest is less
clear in some cases than in others, it does not follow that there is no
right or principle of justice in the case. 3. As to matters of contempt
and the expression of opinion, I think these do not fall under the
head of force, and are not, on that ground, subjects of coercion and
law. For example, if a person inflicts a sensation upon me by material
means, whether tangible or otherwise, I cannot help that sensation;
I am so far the slave of that other, and have no means of resisting
him but by force, which I would define to be material agency.
But if another proposes an opinion to me, I am not bound to be of
this opinion; my judgment and will is left free, and therefore I have
no right to resort to force to recover a liberty which I have not lost.
If I do this to prevent that other from pressing that opinion, it is I
who invade his liberty, without warrant, because without necessity.
It may be urged that material agency, or force, is used in the adoption
of sounds or letters of the alphabet, which I cannot help seeing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>or hearing. But the injury is not here, but in the moral and artificial
inference, which I am at liberty to admit or reject, according to the
evidence. There is no force but argument in the case, and it is
reason, not the will of another, that gives the law. Further, the
opinion expressed, generally concerns not one individual, but the
general interest; and of that my approbation or disapprobation is not
a commensurate or the sole judge. I am judge of my own interests,
because it is my affair, and no one’s else; but by the same rule, I am
not judge, nor have I a <em>veto</em> on that which appeals to all the world,
merely because I have a prejudice or fancy against it. But suppose
another expresses by signs or words a contempt for me? <em>Answer.</em>
I do not know that he is bound to have a respect for me. Opinion
is free; for if I wish him to have that respect, then he must be left
free to judge for himself, and consequently to arrive at and to express
the contrary opinion, or otherwise the verdict and testimony I aim at
could not be obtained; just as players must consent to be hissed, if
they expect to be applauded. Opinion cannot be forced, for it is not
grounded on force, but on evidence and reason, and therefore these
last are the proper instruments to control that opinion, and to make it
favourable to what we wish, or hostile to what we disapprove. In
what relates to action, the will of another is force, or the determining
power: in what relates to opinion, the mere will or <em>ipse dixit</em> of
another is of no avail but as it gains over other opinions to its side,
and therefore neither needs nor admits of force as a counteracting
means to be used against it. But in the case of calumny or indecency:
1. I would say that it is the suppression of truth that gives falsehood
its worst edge. What transpires (however maliciously or secretly)
in spite of the law, is taken for gospel, and as it is impossible to
prevent calumny, so it is impossible to counteract it on the present
system, or while every attempt to answer it is attributed to the people’s
not daring to speak the truth. If any single fact or accident peeps
out, the whole character, having this legal screen before it, is supposed
to be of a piece; and the world, defrauded of the means of coming
to their own conclusion, naturally infer the worst. Hence the saying,
that reputation once gone never returns. If, however, we grant the
general license or liberty of the press, in a scheme where publicity
is the great object, it seems a manifest <em>contre-sens</em> that the author
should be the only thing screened or kept a secret: either, therefore,
an anonymous libeller would be heard with contempt, or if he signed
his name thus —, or thus — —, it would be equivalent to being
branded publicly as a calumniator, or marked with the T. F. (<em>travail
forcé</em>) or the broad R. (rogue) on his back. These are thought
sufficient punishments, and yet they rest on opinion without stripes or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>labour. As to indecency, in proportion as it is flagrant is the shock
and resentment against it; and as vanity is the source of indecency, so
the universal discountenance and shame is its most effectual antidote.
If it is public, it produces immediate reprisals from public opinion
which no brow can stand; and if secret, it had better be left so. No
one can then say it is obtruded on him; and if he will go in search
of it, it seems odd he should call upon the law to frustrate the object
of his pursuit. Further, at the worst, society has its remedy in its
own hands whenever its moral sense is outraged, that is, it may send
to Coventry, or excommunicate like the church of old; for though it
may have no right to prosecute, it is not bound to protect or patronise,
unless by voluntary consent of all parties concerned. Secondly, as to
rights of action, or personal liberty. These have no limit but the
rights of persons or property aforesaid, or to be hereafter named.
They are the channels in which the others run without injury and
without impediment, as a river within its banks. Every one has a
right to use his natural powers in the way most agreeable to himself,
and which he deems most conducive to his own advantage, provided
he does not interfere with the corresponding rights and liberties of
others. He has no right to coerce them by a decision of his individual
will, and as long as he abstains from this he has no right to
be coerced by an expression of the aggregate will, that is, by law.
The law is the emanation of the aggregate will, and this will receives
its warrant to act only from the forcible pressure from without, and its
indispensable resistance to it. Let us see how this will operate to the
pruning and curtailment of law. The rage of legislation is the first
vice of society; it ends by limiting it to as few things as possible,
1. There can, according to the principle here imperfectly sketched,
be no laws for the enforcement of morals; because morals have to do
with the will and affections, and the law only puts a restraint on these.
Every one is politically constituted the judge of what is best for himself;
it is only when he encroaches on others that he can be called
to account. He has no right to say to others, You shall do as I do;
how then should they have a right to say to him, You shall do as we
do? Mere numbers do not convey the right, for the law addresses
not one, but the whole community. For example, there cannot
rightly be a law to set a man in the stocks for getting drunk. It
injures his health, you say. That is his concern, and not mine. But
it is detrimental to his affairs; if so, he suffers most by it. But it is
ruinous to his wife and family: he is their natural and legal guardian.
But they are thrown upon the parish: the parish need not take the
burden upon itself, unless it chooses or has agreed to do so. If a man
is not kind to or fond of his wife I see no law to make him. If he
beats her, or threatens her life, she as clearly has a right to call in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>aid of a constable or justice of peace. I do not see, in like manner,
how there can be law against gambling (against cheating there may),
nor against usury. A man gives twenty, forty, a hundred per cent.
with his eyes open, but would he do it if strong necessity did not
impel him? Certainly no man would give double if he could get the
same advantage for half. There are circumstances in which a rope
to save me from drowning, or a draught of water, would be worth all
I have. In like manner, lotteries are fair things; for the loss is
inconsiderable, and the advantage may be incalculable. I do not
believe the poor put into them, but the reduced rich, the <em>shabby-genteel</em>.
Players were formerly prohibited as a nuisance, and fortune-tellers
still are liable to the Vagrant Act, which the parson of the parish
duly enforces, in his zeal to prevent cheating and imposture, while he
himself has his two livings, and carries off a tenth of the produce of
the soil. Rape is an offence clearly punishable by law; but I would
not say that simple incontinence is so. I will give one more example,
which, though quaint, may explain the distinction I aim at. A man
may commit suicide if he pleases, without being responsible to any one.
He may quit the world as he would quit the country where he was
born. But if any person were to fling himself from the gallery into
the pit of a play-house, so as to endanger the lives of others, if he did
not succeed in killing himself, he would render himself liable to
punishment for the attempt, if it were to be supposed that a person so
desperately situated would care about consequences. Duelling is
lawful on the same principle, where every precaution is taken to show
that the act is voluntary and fair on both sides. I might give other
instances, but these will suffice. 2. There should be a perfect toleration
in matters of religion. In what relates to the salvation of a man’s
soul, he is infinitely more concerned than I can be; and to pretend to
dictate to him in this particular is an infinite piece of impertinence and
presumption. But if a man has no religion at all? That does not
hinder me from having any. If he stood at the church door and
would not let me enter, I should have a right to push him aside; but
if he lets me pass by without interruption, I have no right to turn
back and drag him in after me. He might as well force me to have
no religion as I force him to have one, or burn me at a stake for
believing what he does not. Opinion, ‘like the wild goose, flies
unclaimed of any man:’ heaven is like ‘the marble air, accessible to
all;’ and therefore there is no occasion to trip up one another’s heels
on the road, or to erect a turnpike gate to collect large sums from the
passengers. How have I a right to make another pay for the saving
of my soul, or to assist me in damning his? There should be no
secular interference in sacred things; no laws to suppress or establish
any church or sect in religion, no religious persecutions, tests, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>disqualifications; the different sects should be left to inveigle and hate
each other as much as they please; but without the love of exclusive
domination and spiritual power there would be little temptation to
bigotry and intolerance.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <span class='sc'>As to the Rights of Property.</span> It is of no use a man’s
being left to enjoy security, or to exercise his freedom of action,
unless he has a right to appropriate certain other things necessary to
his comfort and subsistence to his own use. In a state of nature, or
rather of solitary independence, he has a right to all he can lay his
hands on: what then limits this right? Its being inconsistent with
the same right in others. This strikes a mathematical or logical
balance between two extreme and equal pretensions. As there is not a
natural and indissoluble connection between the individual and his property,
or those outward objects of which he may have need (they being
detached, unlimited, and transferable), as there is between the individual
and his person, either as an organ of sensation or action, it is
necessary, in order to prevent endless debate and quarrels, to fix upon
some other criterion or common ground of preference. Animals, or
savages, have no idea of any other right than that of the strongest, and
seize on all they can get by force, without any regard to justice or an
equal claim. 1. One mode of settling the point is to divide the spoil.
That is allowing an equal advantage to both. Thus boys, when they
unexpectedly find anything, are accustomed to cry ‘<em>Halves!</em>’ But
this is liable to other difficulties, and applies only to the case of joint
finding. 2. Priority of possession is a fair way of deciding the right
of property; first, on the mere principle of a lottery, or the old saying,
‘<em>First come, first served</em>;’ secondly, because the expectation having
been excited, and the will more set upon it, this constitutes a powerful
reason for not violently forcing it to let go its hold. The greater
strength of volition is, we have seen, one foundation of right; for
supposing a person to be absolutely indifferent to anything, he could
properly set up no claim to it. 3. Labour, or the having produced a
thing or fitted it for use by previous exertion, gives this right, chiefly,
indeed, for moral and final causes; because if one enjoyed what
another had produced, there would be nothing but idleness and
rapacity; but also in the sense we are inquiring into, because on a
merely selfish ground the labour undergone, or the time lost, is entitled
to an equivalent, <em>cæteris manentibus</em>. 4. If another, voluntarily, or
for a consideration, resigns to me his right in anything, it to all
intents and purposes becomes mine. This accounts not only for gifts,
the transfer of property by bargains, &#38;c., but for legacies and the
transmission of property in families or otherwise. It is hard to make
a law to circumscribe this right of disposing of what we have as we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>please; yet the boasted law of primogeniture, which is professedly
the bulwark and guardian of property is in direct violation of this
principle. 5, and lastly. Where a thing is common, and there is
enough for all, and no one contributes to it, as air or water, there can
be no property in it. The proximity to a herring-fishery, or the
having been the first to establish a particular traffic in such commodities,
may perhaps give this right by aggravating our will, as having a
nearer or longer power over them; but the rule is the other way. It
is on same principle that poaching is a kind of honest thieving, for
that which costs no trouble and is confined to no limits seems to belong
to no one exclusively (why else do poachers or country people seize
on this kind of property with the least reluctance, but that it is the
least like stealing?); and as the game laws and the tenaciousness of
the rights to that which has least the character of property, as most a
point of honour, produced a revolution in one country, so they are not
unlikely to produce it in another. The object and principle of the
laws of property, then, is this: 1. To supply individuals and the
community with what they need. 2. To secure an equal share to
each individual, other circumstances being the same. 3. To keep the
peace and promote industry and plenty, by proportioning each man’s
share to his own exertions, or to the good-will and discretion of
others. The intention, then, being that no individual should rob
another, or be starved but by his refusing to work (the earth and its
produce being the natural estate of the community, subject to these
regulations of individual right and public welfare), the question is,
whether any individual can have a right to rob or starve the whole
community: or if the necessary discretion left in the application of
the principle has led to a state of things subversive of the principle
itself, and destructive to the welfare and existence of the state,
whether the end being defeated, the law does not fall to the ground,
or require either a powerful corrective or a total reconstruction.
The end is superior to the means, and the use of a thing does not
justify its abuse. If a clock is quite out of order and always goes
wrong, it is no argument to say it was set right at first and on true
mechanical principles, and therefore it must go on as it has done,
according to all the rules of art; on the contrary, it is taken to
pieces, repaired, and the whole restored to the original state, or,
if this is impossible, a new one is made. So society, when out of
order, which it is whenever the interests of the many are regularly
and outrageously sacrificed to those of the few, must be repaired, and
either a reform or a revolution cleanse its corruptions and renew its
elasticity. People talk of the poor laws as a grievance. Either they
or a national bankruptcy, or a revolution, are necessary. The labouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>population have not doubled in the last forty years; there are still
no more than are necessary to do the work in husbandry, &#38;c., that is
indispensably required; but the wages of a labouring man are no higher
than they were forty years ago, and the price of food and necessaries
is at least double what it was then, owing to taxes, grants, monopolies,
and immense fortunes gathered during the war by the richer or more
prosperous classes, who have not ceased to propagate in the geometrical
ratio, though the poor have not done it, and the maintaining of whose
younger and increasing branches in becoming splendour and affluence
presses with double weight on the poor and labouring classes. The
greater part of a community ought not to be paupers or starving; and
when a government by obstinacy and madness has reduced them to
that state, it must either take wise and effectual measures to relieve
them from it, or pay the forfeit of its own wickedness and folly.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems, then, that a system of just and useful laws may be
constructed nearly, if not wholly, on the principle of the right of
self-defence, or the security for person, liberty, and property. There
are exceptions, such, for instance, as in the case of children,
idiots, and insane persons. These common sense dictates for a
general principle can only hold good where the general conditions
are complied with. There are also mixed cases, partaking of civil
and moral justice. Is a man bound to support his children? Not in
strict political right; but he may be compelled to forego all the
benefits of civil society, if he does not fulfil an engagement which,
according to the feelings and principles of that society, he has undertaken.
So in respect to marriage. It is a voluntary contract, and the
violation of it is punishable on the same plea of sympathy and custom.
Government is not necessarily founded on common consent, but on
the right which society has to defend itself against all aggression.
But am I bound to pay or support the government for defending the
society against any violence or injustice? No: but then they may
withdraw the protection of the law from me if I refuse, and it is on
this ground that the contributions of each individual to the maintenance
of the state are demanded. Laws are, or ought to be, founded
on the supposed infraction of individual rights. If these rights, and
the best means of maintaining them, are always clear, and there could
be no injustice or abuse of power on the part of the government,
every government might be its own lawgiver: but as neither of these
is the case, it is necessary to recur to the general voice for settling the
boundaries of right and wrong, and even more for preventing the
government, under pretence of the general peace and safety, from
subjecting the whole liberties, rights, and resources of the community
to its own advantage and sole will.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>ON THE CONDUCT OF LIFE; OR, ADVICE TO A SCHOOLBOY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>My dear little Fellow</span>,—You are now going to settle at school,
and may consider this as your first entrance into the world. As my
health is so indifferent, and I may not be with you long, I wish to
leave you some advice (the best I can) for your conduct in life, both
that it may be of use to you, and as something to remember me by.
I may at least be able to caution you against my own errors, if nothing
else.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we went along to your new place of destination, you often
repeated that ‘You durst say they were a set of stupid, disagreeable
people,’ meaning the people at the school. You were to blame in this.
It is a good old rule to hope for the best. Always, my dear, believe
things to be right, till you find them the contrary; and even then,
instead of irritating yourself against them, endeavour to put up with
them as well as you can, if you cannot alter them. You said ‘You
were sure you should not like the school where you were going.’
This was wrong. What you meant was that you did not like to
leave home. But you could not tell whether you should like the
school or not, till you had given it a trial. Otherwise, your saying
that you should not like it was determining that you would not like it.
Never anticipate evils; or, because you cannot have things exactly as
you wish, make them out worse than they are, through mere spite and
wilfulness.</p>

<p class='c007'>You seemed at first to take no notice of your school-fellows, or
rather to set yourself against them, because they were strangers to
you. They knew as little of you as you did of them; so that this
would have been a reason for their keeping aloof from you as well,
which you would have felt as a hardship. Learn never to conceive a
prejudice against others, because you know nothing of them. It is
bad reasoning, and makes enemies of half the world. Do not think
ill of them, till they behave ill to you; and then strive to avoid the
faults which you see in them. This will disarm their hostility sooner
than pique or resentment or complaint.</p>

<p class='c007'>I thought you were disposed to criticise the dress of some of the
boys as not so good as your own. Never despise any one for any
thing that he cannot help—least of all, for his poverty. I would wish
you to keep up appearances yourself as a defence against the idle
sneers of the world, but I would not have you value yourself upon
them. I hope you will neither be the dupe nor victim of vulgar
prejudices. Instead of saying above—‘Never despise any one for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>any thing that he cannot help’—I might have said, ‘Never despise
any one at all;’ for contempt implies a triumph over and pleasure in
the ill of another. It means that you are glad and congratulate yourself
on their failings or misfortunes. The sense of inferiority in
others, without this indirect appeal to our self-love, is a painful feeling,
and not an exulting one.</p>

<p class='c007'>You complain since, that the boys laugh at you and do not care
about you, and that you are not treated as you were at home. My
dear, that is one chief reason for your being sent to school, to inure
you betimes to the unavoidable rubs and uncertain reception you may
meet with in life. You cannot always be with me, and perhaps it is
as well that you cannot. But you must not expect others to show the
same concern about you as I should. You have hitherto been a
spoiled child, and have been used to have your own way a good deal,
both in the house and among your play-fellows, with whom you were
too fond of being a leader: but you have good-nature and good sense,
and will get the better of this in time. You have now got among
other boys who are your equals, or bigger and stronger than yourself,
and who have something else to attend to besides humouring your
whims and fancies, and you feel this as a repulse or piece of injustice.
But the first lesson to learn is that there are other people in the world
besides yourself. There are a number of boys in the school where
you are, whose amusements and pursuits (whatever they may be) are
and ought to be of as much consequence to them as yours can be to
you, and to which therefore you must give way in your turn. The
more airs of childish self-importance you give yourself, you will only
expose yourself to be the more thwarted and laughed at. True
equality is the only true morality or true wisdom. Remember always
that you are but one among others, and you can hardly mistake your
place in society. In your father’s house, you might do as you
pleased: in the world, you will find competitors at every turn. You
are not born a king’s son to destroy or dictate to millions: you can
only expect to share their fate, or settle your differences amicably
with them. You already find it so at school; and I wish you to be
reconciled to your situation as soon and with as little pain as you can.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was my misfortune perhaps to be bred up among Dissenters,
who look with too jaundiced an eye at others, and set too high a
value on their own peculiar pretensions. From being proscribed
themselves, they learn to proscribe others; and come in the end to
reduce all integrity of principle and soundness of opinion within the
pale of their own little communion. Those who were out of it and
did not belong to the class of <em>Rational Dissenters</em>, I was led erroneously
to look upon as hardly deserving the name of rational beings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>Being thus satisfied as to the select few who are ‘the salt of the
earth,’ it is easy to persuade ourselves that we are at the head of
them, and to fancy ourselves of more importance in the scale of true
desert than all the rest of the world put together, who do not interpret
a certain text of Scripture in the manner that we have been taught to
do. You will (from the difference of education) be free from this
bigotry, and will, I hope, avoid every thing akin to the same exclusive
and narrow-minded spirit. Think that the minds of men are various
as their faces—that the modes and employments of life are numberless
as they are necessary—that there is more than one class of merit—that
though others may be wrong in some things, they are not so in
all—and that countless races of men have been born, have lived and
died without ever hearing of any one of those points in which you
take a just pride and pleasure—and you will not err on the side of
that spiritual pride or intellectual coxcombry which has been so often
the bane of the studious and learned!</p>

<p class='c007'>I observe you have got a way of speaking of your school-fellows as
‘<em>that</em> Hoare, <em>that</em> Harris,’ and so on, as if you meant to mark them
out for particular reprobation, or did not think them good enough for
you. It is a bad habit to speak disrespectfully of others: for it will
lead you to think and feel uncharitably towards them. Ill names
beget ill blood. Even where there may be some repeated trifling
provocation, it is better to be courteous, mild, and forbearing, than
captious, impatient, and fretful. The faults of others too often arise
out of our own ill-temper; or though they should be real, we shall
not mend them, by exasperating ourselves against them. Treat your
playmates, as Hamlet advises Polonius to treat the players, ‘according
to your own dignity, rather than their deserts.’ If you fly out at
every thing in them that you disapprove or think done on purpose to
annoy you, you lie constantly at the mercy of their caprice, rudeness,
or ill-nature. You should be more your own master.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not begin to quarrel with the world too soon: for, bad as it
may be, it is the best we have to live in—here. If railing would
have made it better, it would have been reformed long ago: but as
this is not to be hoped for at present, the best way is to slide through
it as contentedly and innocently as we may. The worst fault it has,
is want of charity: and calling <em>knave</em> and <em>fool</em> at every turn will not
cure this failing. Consider (as a matter of vanity) that if there were
not so many knaves and fools as we find, the wise and honest would
not be those rare and shining characters that they are allowed to be;
and (as a matter of philosophy) that if the world be really incorrigible
in this respect, it is a reflection to make one sad, not angry. We
may laugh or weep at the madness of mankind: we have no right to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>vilify them, for our own sakes or theirs. Misanthropy is not the
disgust of the mind at human nature, but with itself; or it is laying
its own exaggerated vices and foul blots at the door of others! Do
not, however, mistake what I have here said. I would not have you,
when you grow up, adopt the low and sordid fashion of palliating
existing abuses or of putting the best face upon the worst things.
I only mean that indiscriminate, unqualified satire can do little good,
and that those who indulge in the most revolting speculations on
human nature, do not themselves always set the fairest examples, or
strive to prevent its lower degradation. They seem rather willing to
reduce it to their theoretical standard. For the rest, the very outcry
that is made (if sincere) shews that things cannot be quite so bad as
they are represented. The abstract hatred and scorn of vice implies
the capacity for virtue: the impatience expressed at the most striking
instances of deformity proves the innate idea and love of beauty in
the human mind. The best antidote I can recommend to you hereafter
against the disheartening effect of such writings as those of
Rochefoucault, Mandeville, and others, will be to look at the pictures
of Raphael and Correggio. You need not be altogether ashamed,
my dear little boy, of belonging to a species which could produce
such faces as those; nor despair of doing something worthy of a
laudable ambition, when you see what such hands have wrought!
You will, perhaps, one day have reason to thank me for this advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to your studies and school-exercises, I wish you to learn Latin,
French, and dancing. I would insist upon the last more particularly,
both because it is more likely to be neglected, and because it is of
the greatest consequence to your success in life. Every thing almost
depends upon first impressions; and these depend (besides <em>person</em>,
which is not in our power) upon two things, <em>dress</em> and <em>address</em>, which
every one may command with proper attention. These are the small
coin in the intercourse of life, which are continually in request; and
perhaps you will find at the year’s end, or towards the close of life,
that the daily insults, coldness, or contempt, to which you have been
exposed by a neglect of such superficial recommendations, are hardly
atoned for by the few proofs of esteem or admiration which your
integrity or talents have been able to extort in the course of it.
When we habitually disregard those things which we know will
ensure the favourable opinion of others, it shews we set that opinion at
defiance, or consider ourselves above it, which no one ever did with
impunity. An inattention to our own persons implies a disrespect to
others, and may often be traced no less to a want of good-nature than
of good sense. The old maxim—<em>Desire to please, and you will infallibly
please</em>—explains the whole matter. If there is a tendency to vanity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>and affectation on this side of the question, there is an equal alloy of
pride and obstinacy on the opposite one. Slovenliness may at any
time be cured by an effort of resolution, but a graceful carriage
requires an early habit, and in most cases the aid of the dancing-master.
I would not have you, from not knowing how to enter a room properly,
stumble at the very threshold in the good graces of those on whom it
is possible the fate of your future life may depend. Nothing creates
a greater prejudice against any one than awkwardness. A person who
is confused in manner and gesture seems to have done something
wrong, or as if he was conscious of no one qualification to build a
confidence in himself upon. On the other hand, openness, freedom,
self-possession, set others at ease with you by shewing that you are on
good terms with yourself. Grace in women gains the affections
sooner, and secures them longer, than any thing else—it is an outward
and visible sign of an inward harmony of soul—as the want of it in
men, as if the mind and body equally hitched in difficulties and were
distracted with doubts, is the greatest impediment in the career of
gallantry and road to the female heart. Another thing I would
caution you against is not to pore over your books till you are bent
almost double—a habit you will never be able to get the better of,
and which you will find of serious ill consequence. <em>A stoop in the
shoulders</em> sinks a man in public and in private estimation. You are at
present straight enough, and you walk with boldness and spirit. Do
nothing to take away the use of your limbs, or the spring and elasticity
of your muscles. As to all worldly advantages, it is to the full of as
much importance that your deportment should be erect and manly as
your actions.</p>

<p class='c007'>You will naturally find out all this and fall into it, if your attention
is drawn out sufficiently to what is passing around you; and this will
be the case, unless you are absorbed too much in books and those
sedentary studies,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Which waste the marrow, and consume the brain.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You are, I think, too fond of reading as it is. As one means of
avoiding excess in this way, I would wish you to make it a rule,
never to read at meal-times, nor in company when there is any (even
the most trivial) conversation going on, nor ever to let your eagerness
to learn encroach upon your play-hours. Books are but one inlet of
knowledge; and the pores of the mind, like those of the body, should
be left open to all impressions. I applied too close to my studies,
soon after I was of your age, and hurt myself irreparably by it.
Whatever may be the value of learning, health and good spirits are
of more.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>I would have you, as I said, make yourself master of French,
because you may find it of use in the commerce of life; and I would
have you learn Latin, partly because I learnt it myself, and I would
not have you without any of the advantages or sources of knowledge
that I possessed—it would be a bar of separation between us—and
secondly, because there is an atmosphere round this sort of classical
ground, to which that of actual life is gross and vulgar. Shut out
from this garden of early sweetness, we may well exclaim—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘How shall we part and wander down</div>
      <div class='line'>Into a lower world, to this obscure</div>
      <div class='line'>And wild? How shall we breathe in other air</div>
      <div class='line'>Less pure, accustom’d to immortal fruits?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I do not think the Classics so indispensable to the cultivation of your
intellect as on another account, which I have seen explained elsewhere,
and you will have no objection to turn with me to the passage.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The study of the Classics is less to be regarded as an exercise of
the intellect, than as <em>a discipline of humanity</em>. The peculiar advantage
of this mode of education consists not so much in strengthening the
understanding, as in softening and refining the taste. It gives men
liberal views; it accustoms the mind to take an interest in things
foreign to itself; to love virtue for its own sake; to prefer fame to
life, and glory to riches; and to fix our thoughts on the remote and
permanent, instead of narrow and fleeting objects. It teaches us to
believe that there is something really great and excellent in the world,
surviving all the shocks of accident and fluctuations of opinion, and
raises us above that low and servile fear, which bows only to
present power and upstart authority. Rome and Athens filled a
place in the history of mankind, which can never be occupied again.
They were two cities set on a hill, which could not be hid; all eyes
have seen them, and their light shines like a mighty sea-mark into the
abyss of time.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Still green with bays each ancient altar stands,</div>
      <div class='line'>Above the reach of sacrilegious hands;</div>
      <div class='line'>Secure from flames, from envy’s fiercer rage,</div>
      <div class='line'>Destructive war, and all-involving age.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hail, bards triumphant, born in happier days,</div>
      <div class='line'>Immortal heirs of universal praise!</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose honours with increase of ages grow,</div>
      <div class='line'>As streams roll down, enlarging as they flow!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is this feeling more than any thing else which produces a marked
difference between the study of the ancient and modern languages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>and which, by the weight and importance of the consequences attached
to the former, stamps every word with a monumental firmness. By
conversing with the <em>mighty dead</em>, we imbibe sentiment with knowledge.
We become strongly attached to those who can no longer either hurt
or serve us, except through the influence which they exert over the
mind. We feel the presence of that power which gives immortality
to human thoughts and actions, and catch the flame of enthusiasm
from all nations and ages.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Because, however, you have learnt Latin and Greek, and can
speak a different language, do not fancy yourself of a different order
of beings from those you ordinarily converse with. They perhaps
know and can do more <em>things</em> than you, though you have learnt a
greater variety of <em>names</em> to express the same thing by. The great
object indeed of these studies is to be ‘a cure for a narrow and selfish
spirit,’ and to carry the mind out of its petty and local prejudices to
the idea of a more general humanity. Do not fancy, because you are
intimate with Homer and Virgil, that your neighbours who can never
attain the same posthumous fame are to be despised, like those
impudent valets who live in noble families and look down upon every
one else. Though you are master of Cicero’s ‘Orations,’ think it
possible for a cobbler at a stall to be more eloquent than you. ‘But
you are a scholar, and he is not.’ Well, then, you have that advantage
over him, but it does not follow that you are to have every other.
Look at the heads of the celebrated poets and philosophers of
antiquity in the collection at Wilton, and you will say they answer to
their works: but you will find others in the same collection whose
names have hardly come down to us, that are equally fine, and cast in
the same classic mould. Do you imagine that all the thoughts,
genius, and capacity of those old and mighty nations are contained in
a few odd volumes, to be thumbed by school-boys? This reflection
is not meant to lessen your admiration of the great names to which
you will be accustomed to look up, but to direct it to that solid mass
of intellect and power, of which they were the most shining ornaments.
I would wish you to excel in this sort of learning and to take a
pleasure in it, because it is the path that has been chosen for you: but
do not suppose that others do not excel equally in their line of study
or exercise of skill, or that there is but one mode of excellence in art
or nature. You have got on vastly beyond the point at which you set
out; but others have been getting on as well as you in the same or
other ways, and have kept pace with you. What then, you may ask,
is the use of all the pains you have taken, if it gives you no superiority
over mankind in general? It is this—You have reaped all the benefit
of improvement and knowledge yourself; and farther, if you had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>moved forwards, you would by this time have been left behind.
Envy no one, disparage no one, think yourself above no one. Their
demerits will not piece out your deficiences; nor is it a waste of time
and labour for you to cultivate your own talents, because you cannot
bespeak a monopoly of all advantages. You are more learned than
many of your acquaintance who may be more active, healthy, witty,
successful in business or expert in some elegant or useful art than
you; but you have no reason to complain, if you have attained the
object of your ambition. Or if you should not be able to compass
this from a want of genius or parts, yet learn, my child, to be contented
with a mediocrity of acquirements. You may still be respectable
in your conduct, and enjoy a tranquil obscurity, with more friends
and fewer enemies than you might otherwise have had.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is one almost certain drawback on a course of scholastic
study, that it unfits men for active life. The <em>ideal</em> is always at
variance with the <em>practical</em>. The habit of fixing the attention on the
imaginary and abstracted deprives the mind equally of energy and
fortitude. By indulging our imaginations on fictions and chimeras,
where we have it all our own way and are led on only by the pleasure
of the prospect, we grow fastidious, effeminate, lapped in idle luxury,
impatient of contradiction, and unable to sustain the shock of real
adversity, when it comes; as by being taken up with abstract reasoning
or remote events in which we are merely passive spectators, we
have no resources to provide against it, no readiness, or expedients
for the occasion, or spirit to use them, even if they occur. We must
think again before we determine, and thus the opportunity for action is
lost. While we are considering the very best possible mode of
gaining an object, we find that it has slipped through our fingers, or
that others have laid rude, fearless hands upon it. The youthful tyro
reluctantly discovers that the ways of the world are not his ways, nor
their thoughts his thoughts. Perhaps the old monastic institutions
were not in this respect unwise, which carried on to the end of life
the secluded habits and romantic associations with which it began, and
which created a privileged world for the inhabitants, distinct from the
common world of men and women. You will bring with you from
your books and solitary reveries a wrong measure of men and things,
unless you correct it by careful experience and mixed observation.
You will raise your standard of character as much too high at first as
from disappointed expectation it will sink too low afterwards. The
best qualifier of this theoretical <em>mania</em> and of the dreams of poets and
moralists (who both treat of things as <em>they ought to be</em> and not as <em>they
are</em>) is in one sense to be found in some of our own popular writers,
such as our Novelists and periodical Essayists. But you had, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>all, better wait and see what things are than try to anticipate the
results. You know more of a road by having travelled it than by all
the conjectures and descriptions in the world. You will find the
business of life conducted on a much more varied and individual scale
than you would expect. People will be concerned about a thousand
things that you have no idea of, and will be utterly indifferent to what
you feel the greatest interest in. You will find good and evil, folly
and discretion more mingled, and the shades of character running
more into each other than they do in the ethical charts. No one is
equally wise or guarded at all points, and it is seldom that any one is
quite a fool. Do not be surprised, when you go out into the world,
to find men talk exceedingly well on different subjects, who do not
derive their information immediately from books. In the first place,
the light of books is diffused very much abroad in the world in conversation
and at second-hand; and besides, common sense is not a
monopoly, and experience and observation are sources of information
open to the man of the world as well as to the retired student. If
you know more of the outline and principles, he knows more of the
details and ‘practique part of life.’ A man may discuss the adventures
of a campaign in which he was engaged very agreeably without having
read the <em>Retreat of the Ten Thousand</em>, or give a singular account of
the method of drying teas in China without being a profound chemist.
It is the vice of scholars to suppose that there is no knowledge in the
world but that of books. Do you avoid it, I conjure you; and
thereby save yourself the pain and mortification that must otherwise
ensue from finding out your mistake continually!</p>

<p class='c007'>Gravity is one great ingredient in the conduct of life, and perhaps
a certain share of it is hardly to be dispensed with. Few people can
afford to be quite unaffected. At any rate, do not put your worst
qualities foremost. Do not seek to distinguish yourself by being
ridiculous; nor entertain that miserable ambition to be the sport and
butt of the company. By aiming at a certain standard of behaviour
or intellect, you will at least show your taste and value for what is
excellent. There are those who <em>blurt</em> out their good things with so
little heed of what they are about that no one thinks any thing of
them; as others by keeping their folly to themselves gain the reputation
of wisdom. Do not, however, affect to speak only in oracles, or
to deal in <em>bon-mots</em>: condescend to the level of the company, and be
free and accessible to all persons. Express whatever occurs to you,
that cannot offend others or hurt yourself. Keep some opinions to
yourself. Say what you please of others, but never repeat what you
hear said of them to themselves. If you have nothing to offer yourself,
laugh with the witty, assent to the wise; they will not think the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>worse of you for it. Listen to information on subjects you are
unacquainted with, instead of always striving to lead the conversation
to some favourite one of your own. By the last method you will
shine, but will not improve. I am ashamed myself ever to open my
lips on any question I have ever written upon. It is much more
difficult to be able to converse on an equality with a number of
persons in turn, than to soar above their heads, and excite the stupid
gaze of all companies by bestriding some senseless topic of your own
and confounding the understandings of those who are ignorant of it.
Be not too fond of argument. Indeed, by going much into company
(which I do not, however, wish you to do) you will be weaned from
this practice, if you set out with it. Rather suggest what remarks
may have occurred to you on a subject than aim at dictating your
opinions to others or at defending yourself at all points. You will
learn more by agreeing in the main with others and entering into their
trains of thinking, than by contradicting and urging them to extremities.
Avoid singularity of opinion as well as of everything else. Sound
conclusions come with practical knowledge, rather than with speculative
refinements: in what we really understand, we reason but little.
Long-winded disputes fill up the place of common sense and candid
inquiry. Do not imagine that you will make people friends by
showing your superiority over them: it is what they will neither
admit nor forgive, unless you have a high and acknowledged reputation
beforehand, which renders this sort of petty vanity more
inexcusable. Seek to gain the good-will of others, rather than to
extort their applause; and to this end, be neither too tenacious
of your own claims, nor inclined to press too hard on their
weaknesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not affect the society of your inferiors in rank, nor court that
of the great. There can be no real sympathy in either case. The
first will consider you as a restraint upon them, and the last as an
intruder or <em>upon sufferance</em>. It is not a desirable distinction to be
admitted into company as a man of talents. You are a mark for
invidious observation. If you say nothing or merely behave with
common propriety and simplicity, you seem to have no business there.
If you make a studied display of yourself, it is arrogating a consequence
you have no right to. If you are contented to pass as an
indifferent person, they despise you; if you distinguish yourself, and
show more knowledge, wit, or taste than they do, they hate you for
it. You have no alternative. I would rather be asked out to sing
than to talk. Every one does not pretend to a fine voice, but every
one fancies he has as much understanding as another. Indeed, the
secret of this sort of intercourse has been pretty well found out.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>Literary men are seldom invited to the tables of the great; they send
for players and musicians, as they keep monkeys and parrots!</p>

<p class='c007'>I would not, however, have you run away with a notion that the
rich are knaves or that lords are fools. They are for what I know as
honest and as wise as other people. But it is a trick of our self-love,
supposing that another has the decided advantage of us in one way, to
strike a balance by taking it for granted (as a moral antithesis) that he
must be as much beneath us in those qualities on which we plume
ourselves, and which we would appropriate almost entirely to our own
use. It is hard indeed if others are raised above us not only by the
gifts of fortune, but of understanding too. It is not to be credited.
People have an unwillingness to admit that the House of Lords can
be equal in talent to the House of Commons. So in the other sex,
if a woman is handsome, she is an idiot or no better than she should
be: in ours, if a man is worth a million of money, he is a miser, a
fellow that cannot spell his own name, or a poor creature in some
way, to bring him to our level. This is malice, and not truth.
Believe all the good you can of every one. Do not measure others
by yourself. If they have advantages which you have not, let your
liberality keep pace with their good fortune. Envy no one, and you
need envy no one. If you have but the magnanimity to allow merit
wherever you see it—understanding in a lord or wit in a cobbler—this
temper of mind will stand you instead of many accomplishments.
Think no man too happy. Raphael died young. Milton had the
misfortune to be blind. If any one is vain or proud, it is from folly
or ignorance. Those who pique themselves excessively on some one
thing, have but that one thing to pique themselves upon, as languages,
mechanics, &#38;c. I do not say that this is not an enviable delusion
where it is not liable to be disturbed; but at present knowledge is too
much diffused and pretensions come too much into collision for this
to be long the case; and it is better not to form such a prejudice at
<em>first</em> than to have it to undo all the rest of one’s life. If you learn
any two things, though they may put you out of conceit one with the
other, they will effectually cure you of any conceit you might have of
yourself, by shewing the variety and scope there is in the human mind
beyond the limits you had set to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>You were convinced the first day that you could not learn Latin,
which now you find easy. Be taught from this, not to think other
obstacles insurmountable that you may meet with in the course of
your life, though they seem so at first sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Attend above all things to your health; or rather, do nothing
wilfully to impair it. Use exercise, abstinence, and regular hours.
Drink water when you are alone, and wine or very little spirits in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>company. It is the last that are ruinous by leading to unlimited
excess. There is not the same headlong <em>impetus</em> in wine. But one
glass of brandy and water makes you want another, that other makes
you want a third, and so on, in an increased proportion. Therefore
no one can stop midway who does not possess the resolution to abstain
altogether; for the inclination is sharpened with its indulgence.
Never gamble. Or if you play for any thing, never do so for what
will give you uneasiness the next day. Be not precise in these
matters: but do not pass certain limits, which it is difficult to recover.
Do nothing in the irritation of the moment, but take time to reflect.
Because you have done one foolish thing, do not do another; nor
throw away your health or reputation or comfort, to thwart impertinent
advice. Avoid a spirit of contradiction, both in words and actions.
Do not aim at what is beyond your reach, but at what is within it.
Indulge in calm and pleasing pursuits, rather than violent excitements;
and learn to conquer your own will, instead of striving to obtain the
mastery of that of others.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to your friends, I would wish you to choose them
neither from caprice nor accident, and to adhere to them as long as
you can. Do not make a surfeit of friendship, through over-sanguine
enthusiasm, nor expect it to last for ever. Always speak well of
those with whom you have once been intimate, or take some part of
the censure you bestow on them to yourself. Never quarrel with
tried friends, or those whom you wish to continue such. Wounds
of this kind are sure to open again. When once the prejudice is
removed that sheathes defects, familiarity only causes jealousy and
distrust. Do not keep on with a mockery of friendship after the
substance is gone—but part, while you can part friends. Bury the
carcase of friendship: it is not worth embalming.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the books you will have to read by choice or for amusement,
the best are the commonest. The names of many of them are
already familiar to you. Read them as you grow up with all the
satisfaction in your power, and make much of them. It is perhaps
the greatest pleasure you will have in life, the one you will think of
longest, and repent of least. If my life had been more full of
calamity than it has been (much more than I hope yours will be)
I would live it over again, my poor little boy, to have read the books
I did in my youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>In politics I wish you to be an honest man, but no brawler. Hate
injustice and falsehood for your own sake. Be neither a martyr, nor
a sycophant. Wish well to the world without expecting to see it
much better than it is; and do not gratify the enemies of liberty
by putting yourself at their mercy, if it can be avoided with honour.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>If you ever marry, I would wish you to marry the woman you
like. Do not be guided by the recommendation of friends. Nothing
will atone for or overcome an original distaste. It will only increase
from intimacy; and if you are to live separate, it is better not to
come together. There is no use in dragging a chain through life,
unless it binds one to the object we love. Choose a mistress from
among your equals. You will be able to understand her character
better, and she will be more likely to understand yours. Those in
an inferior station to yourself will doubt your good intentions, and
misapprehend your plainest expressions. All that you swear is to
them a riddle or downright nonsense. You cannot by possibility
translate your thoughts into their dialect. They will be ignorant of
the meaning of half you say, and laugh at the rest. As mistresses,
they will have no sympathy with you; and as wives, you can have
none with them. But they will do all they can to thwart you,
and to retrieve themselves in their own opinion by trick and low
cunning. No woman ever married into a family above herself that
did not try to make all the mischief she could in it. Be not in haste
to marry, nor to engage your affections, where there is no probability
of a return. Do not fancy every woman you see the heroine of a
romance, a Sophia Western, a Clarissa, or a Julia; and yourself the
potential hero of it, Tom Jones, Lovelace, or St. Preux. Avoid
this error as you would shrink back from a precipice. All your fine
sentiments and romantic notions will (of themselves) make no more
impression on one of these delicate creatures, than on a piece of
marble. Their soft bosoms are steel to your amorous refinements, if
you have no other pretensions. It is not what you think of them
that determines their choice, but what they think of you. Endeavour,
if you would escape lingering torments and the gnawing of the worm
that dies not, to find out this, and to abide by the issue. We trifle
with, make sport of, and despise those who are attached to us, and
follow those that fly from us. ‘We hunt the wind, we worship a
statue, cry aloud to the desert.’ Do you, my dear boy, stop short
in this career, if you find yourself setting out in it, and make up your
mind to this, that if a woman does not like you of her own accord,
that is, from involuntary impressions, nothing you can say or do or
suffer for her sake will make her, but will set her the more against
you. So the song goes—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Quit, quit for shame; this will not move:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>If of herself she will not love,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nothing will make her, the devil take her!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Your pain is her triumph; the more she feels you in her power,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>the worse she will treat you: the more you make it appear you
deserve her regard, the more will she resent it as an imputation on
her first judgment. Study first impressions above all things; for
every thing depends on them, in love especially. Women are armed
by nature and education with a power of resisting the importunity of
men, and they use this power according to their discretion. They
enforce it to the utmost rigour of the law against those whom they
do not like, and relax their extreme severity proportionably in favour
of those that they do like and who in general care as little about them.
Hence we see so many desponding lovers and forlorn damsels. Love
in women (at least) is either vanity, or interest, or fancy. It is a
merely selfish feeling. It has nothing to do (I am sorry to say) with
friendship, or esteem, or even pity. I once asked a girl, the pattern
of her sex in shape and mind and attractions, whether she did not think
Mr. Coleridge had done wrong in making the heroine of his beautiful
ballad story of Geneviève take compassion on her hapless lover—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘When on the yellow forest-leaves</div>
      <div class='line'>A dying man he lay—’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And whether she believed that any woman ever fell in love through
a sense of compassion; and she made answer—‘Not if it was against
her inclination!’ I would take the lady’s word <em>for a thousand pound</em>,
on this point. Pain holds antipathy to pleasure; pity is not akin to
love; a dying man has more need of a nurse than of a mistress.
There is no forcing liking. It is as little to be fostered by reason
and good-nature, as it can be controlled by prudence or propriety.
It is a mere blind, headstrong impulse. Least of all flatter yourself
that talents or virtue will recommend you to the favour of the sex, in
lieu of exterior advantages. Oh! no. Women care nothing about
poets, or philosophers, or politicians. They go by a man’s looks and
manner. Richardson calls them ‘an eye-judging sex;’ and I am
sure he knew more about them than I can pretend to do. If you
run away with a pedantic notion that they care a pin’s-point about
your head or your heart, you will repent it too late. Some bluestocking
may have her vanity flattered by your reputation or be edified
by the solution of a metaphysical problem or a critical remark or a
dissertation on the state of the nation, and fancy that she has a taste
for intellect and is an epicure in sentiment. No true woman ever
regarded any thing but her lover’s person and address. Gravity will
here answer all the same purpose without understanding, gaiety
without wit, folly without good-nature, and impudence without any
other pretension. The natural and instinctive passion of love is
excited by qualities not peculiar to artists, authors, and men of letters.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>It is not the jest but the laugh that follows, not the sentiment but the
glance that accompanies it, that <em>tells</em>—in a word, the sense of actual
enjoyment that imparts itself to others, and excites mutual understanding
and inclination. Authors, on the other hand, feel nothing
spontaneously. The common incidents and circumstances of life
with which others are taken up, make no alteration in them, nor
provoke any of the common expressions of surprise, joy, admiration,
anger, or merriment. Nothing stirs their blood or accelerates their
juices or tickles their veins. Instead of yielding to the first natural
and lively impulses of things, in which they would find sympathy,
they screw themselves up to some far-fetched view of the subject in
order to be unintelligible. Realities are not good enough for them,
till they undergo the process of imagination and reflection. If you
offer them your hand to shake, they will hardly take it; for this does
not amount to a proposition. If you enter their room suddenly, they
testify neither surprise nor satisfaction: no new idea is elicited by it.
Yet if you suppose this to be a repulse, you are mistaken. They will
enter into your affairs or combat your ideas with all the warmth and
vehemence imaginable, as soon as they have a subject started. But
their faculty for thinking must be set in motion, before you can put
any soul into them. They are intellectual dram-drinkers; and without
their necessary stimulus, are torpid, dead, insensible to every
thing. They have great life of mind, but none of body. They do
not drift with the stream of company or of passing occurrences, but
are straining at some hyperbole or striking out a bye-path of their
own. Follow them who list. Their minds are a sort of Herculaneum,
full of old, petrified images;—are set in stereotype, and little
fitted to the ordinary occasions of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>What chance, then, can they have with women, who deal only in
the pantomime of discourse, in gesticulation and the flippant bye-play
of the senses, ‘nods and winks and wreathed smiles;’ and to whom
to offer a remark is an impertinence, or a reason an affront? The
only way in which I ever knew mental qualities or distinction tell was
in the clerical character; and women do certainly incline to this with
some sort of favourable regard. Whether it is that the sanctity of
pretension piques curiosity, or that the habitual submission of their
understandings to their spiritual guides subdues the will, a popular
preacher generally has the choice among the <em>élite</em> of his female flock.
According to Mrs. Inchbald (see her ‘Simple Story’) there is
another reason why religious courtship is not without its charms!
But as I do not intend you for the church, do not, in thinking to
study yourself into the good graces of the fair, study yourself out of
them, millions of miles. Do not place thought as a barrier between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>you and love: do not abstract yourself into the regions of truth,
far from the smile of earthly beauty. Let not the cloud sit upon
your brow: let not the canker sink into your heart. Look up, laugh
loud, talk big, keep the colour in your cheek and the fire in your eye,
adorn your person, maintain your health, your beauty, and your
animal spirits, and you will pass for a fine man. But should you let
your blood stagnate in some deep metaphysical question, or refine too
much in your ideas of the sex, forgetting yourself in a dream of
exalted perfection, you will want an eye to cheer you, a hand to
guide you, a bosom to lean on, and will stagger into your grave, old
before your time, unloved and unlovely. If you feel that you have
not the necessary advantages of person, confidence, and manner, and
that it is <em>up-hill</em> work with you to gain the ear of beauty, quit the
pursuit at once, and seek for other satisfactions and consolations.</p>

<p class='c007'>A spider, my dear, the meanest creature that crawls or lives, has
its mate or fellow: but a scholar has no mate or fellow. For myself,
I had courted thought, I had felt pain; and Love turned away his
face from me. I have gazed along the silent air for that smile which
had lured me to my doom. I no more heard those accents which
would have burst upon me, like a voice from heaven. I loathed the
light that shone on my disgrace. Hours, days, years, passed away;
and only turned false hope to fixed despair. And as my frail bark
sails down the stream of time, the God of Love stands on the shore,
and as I stretch out my hands to him in vain, claps his wings, and
mocks me as I pass!</p>

<p class='c007'>There is but one other point on which I meant to speak to you, and
that is the choice of a profession. This, probably, had better be left
to time or accident or your own inclination. You have a very fine ear,
but I have somehow a prejudice against men-singers, and indeed
against the stage altogether. It is an uncertain and ungrateful soil.
All professions are bad that depend on reputation, which is ‘as often
got without merit as lost without deserving.’ Yet I cannot easily
reconcile myself to your being a slave to business, and I shall hardly
be able to leave you an independence. A situation in a public office
is secure, but laborious and mechanical, and without the two great
springs of life, Hope and Fear. Perhaps, however, it might ensure
you a competence, and leave you leisure for some other favourite
amusement or pursuit. I have said all reputation is hazardous, hard
to win, harder to keep. Many never attain a glimpse of what they
have all their lives been looking for, and others survive a passing
shadow of it. Yet if I were to name one pursuit rather than another,
I should wish you to be a good painter, if such a thing could be
hoped. I have failed in this myself, and should wish you to be able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>to do what I have not—to paint like Claude or Rembrandt or Guido
or Vandyke, if it were possible. Artists, I think, who have succeeded
in their chief object, live to be old, and are agreeable old men.
Their minds keep alive to the last. Cosway’s spirits never flagged
till after ninety, and Nollekins, though nearly blind, passed all his
mornings in giving directions about some group or bust in his workshop.
You have seen Mr. Northcote, that delightful specimen of the
last age. With what avidity he takes up his pencil, or lays it down
again to talk of numberless things! His eye has not lost its lustre,
nor ‘paled its ineffectual fire.’ His body is a shadow: he himself
is a pure spirit. There is a kind of immortality about this sort of
ideal and visionary existence that dallies with Fate and baffles the
grim monster, Death. If I thought you could make as clever an
artist and arrive at such an agreeable old age as Mr. Northcote,
I should declare at once for your devoting yourself to this enchanting
profession; and in that reliance, should feel less regret at some of my
own disappointments, and little anxiety on your account!</p>

<p class='c006'>It is an axiom in modern philosophy (among many other false ones)
that belief is absolutely involuntary, since we draw our inferences from
the premises laid before us and cannot possibly receive any other
impression of things than that which they naturally make upon us.
This theory, that the understanding is purely passive in the reception
of truth, and that our convictions are not in the power of our will,
was probably first invented or insisted upon as a screen against
religious persecution, and as an answer to those who imputed bad
motives to all who differed from the established faith, and thought
they could reform heresy and impiety by the application of fire and
the sword. No doubt, that is not the way: for the will in that case
irritates itself and grows refractory against the doctrines thus absurdly
forced upon it; and as it has been said, the blood of the martyrs is
the seed of the Church. But though force and terror may not be
always the surest way to make converts, it does not follow that there
may not be other means of influencing our opinions, besides the naked
and abstract evidence for any proposition: the sun melts the resolution
which the storm could not shake. In such points as, whether less
an object is black or white, or whether two and two make four,<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c008'><sup>[61]</sup></a> we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>may not be able to believe as we please or to deny the evidence of
our reason and senses: but in those points on which mankind differ,
or where we can be at all in suspense as to which side we shall take,
the truth is not quite so plain or palpable; it admits of a variety of
views and shades of colouring, and it should appear that we can dwell
upon whichever of these we choose, and heighten or soften the
circumstances adduced in proof, according as passion and inclination
throw their casting-weight into the scale. Let any one, for instance,
have been brought up in an opinion, let him have remained in it all
his life, let him have attached all his notions of respectability, of the
approbation of his fellow-citizens or his own self-esteem to it, let him
then first hear it called in question and a strong and unforeseen
objection stated to it, will not this startle and shock him as if he
had seen a spectre, and will he not struggle to resist the arguments
that would unsettle his habitual convictions, as he would resist the
divorcing of soul and body? Will he come to the consideration of
the question impartially, indifferently, and without any wrong bias,
or give the painful and revolting truth the same cordial welcome as the
long-cherished and favourite prejudice? To say that the truth or
falsehood of a proposition is the only circumstance that gains it
admittance into the mind, independently of the pleasure or pain it
affords us, is itself an assertion made in pure caprice or desperation.
A person may have a profession or employment connected with a
certain belief, it may be the means of livelihood to him, and the
changing it may require considerable sacrifices or may leave him
almost without resource (to say nothing of mortified pride)—this will
not mend the matter. The evidence against his former opinion may
be so strong (or may appear so to him) that he may be obliged to give
it up, but not without a pang and after having tried every artifice and
strained every nerve to give the utmost weight to the arguments
favouring his own side, and to make light of and throw those against
him into the back-ground. And nine times in ten this bias of the will
and tampering with the proofs will prevail. It is only with very
vigorous or very candid minds, that the understanding exercises its
just and boasted prerogative and induces its votaries to relinquish a
profitable delusion and embrace the dowerless truth. Even then they
have the sober and discreet part of the world, all the <em>bons pères de
famille</em>, who look principally to the main-chance, against them, and
they are regarded as little better than lunatics or profligates to fling up
a good salary and a provision for themselves and families for the sake
of that foolish thing, a <em>Conscience</em>! With the herd, belief on all
abstract and disputed topics is voluntary, that is, is determined by
considerations of personal ease and convenience, in the teeth of logical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>analysis and demonstration, which are set aside as mere waste of
words. In short, generally speaking, people stick to an opinion that
they have long supported and that supports them. How else shall we
account for the regular order and progression of society: for the
maintenance of certain opinions in particular professions and classes of
men, as we keep water in cisterns, till in fact they stagnate and corrupt:
and that the world and every individual in it is not ‘blown
about with every wind of doctrine’ and whisper of uncertainty?
There is some more solid ballast required to keep things in their
established order than the restless fluctuation of opinion and ‘infinite
agitation of wit.’ We find that people in Protestant countries continue
Protestants and in Catholic countries Papists. This, it may be
answered, is owing to the ignorance of the great mass of them; but
is their faith less bigoted, because it is not founded on a regular
investigation of the proofs, and is merely an obstinate determination
to believe what they have been told and accustomed to believe? Or
is it not the same with the doctors of the church and its most learned
champions, who read the same texts, turn over the same authorities,
and discuss the same knotty points through their whole lives, only to
arrive at opposite conclusions? How few are shaken in their opinions,
or have the grace to confess it! Shall we then suppose them all
impostors, and that they keep up the farce of a system, of which they
do not believe a syllable? Far from it: there may be individual
instances, but the generality are not only sincere but bigots. Those
who are unbelievers and hypocrites scarcely know it themselves, or if
a man is not quite a knave, what pains will he not take to make a
fool of his reason, that his opinions may tally with his professions?
Is there then a Papist and a Protestant understanding—one prepared
to receive the doctrine of transubstantiation and the other to reject it?
No such thing: but in either case the ground of reason is preoccupied
by passion, habit, example—<em>the scales are falsified</em>. Nothing
can therefore be more inconsequential than to bring the authority of
great names in favour of opinions long established and universally
received. Cicero’s being a Pagan was no proof in support of the
Heathen mythology, but simply of his being born at Rome before the
Christian era; though his lurking scepticism on the subject and
sneers at the augurs told against it, for this was an acknowledgment
drawn from him in spite of a prevailing prejudice. Sir Isaac Newton
and Napier of Marchiston both wrote on the <em>Apocalypse</em>; but this is
neither a ground for a speedy anticipation of the Millennium, nor does
it invalidate the doctrine of the gravitation of the planets or the
theory of logarithms. One party would borrow the sanction of these
great names in support of their wildest and most mystical opinions;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>others would arraign them of folly and weakness for having attended
to such subjects at all. Neither inference is just. It is a simple
question of chronology, or of the time when these celebrated mathematicians
lived, and of the studies and pursuits which were then
chiefly in vogue. The wisest man is the slave of opinion, except on
one or two points on which he strikes out a light for himself and
holds a torch to the rest of the world. But we are disposed to make
it out that all opinions are the result of reason, because they profess to
be so; and when they are <em>right</em>, that is, when they agree with ours,
that there can be no alloy of human frailty or perversity in them; the
very strength of our prejudice making it pass for pure reason, and
leading us to attribute any deviation from it to bad faith or some
unaccountable singularity or infatuation. <em>Alas, poor human nature!</em>
Opinion is for the most part only a battle, in which we take part and
defend the side we have adopted, in the one case or the other, with a
view to share the honour or the spoil. Few will stand up for a losing
cause or have the fortitude to adhere to a proscribed opinion; and
when they do, it is not always from superior strength of understanding
or a disinterested love of truth, but from obstinacy and sullenness
of temper. To affirm that we do not cultivate an acquaintance with
truth as she presents herself to us in a more or less pleasing shape,
or is shabbily attired or well-dressed, is as much as to say that we do
not shut our eyes to the light when it dazzles us, or withdraw our
hands from the fire when it scorches us.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Are we not averse to believe bad news relating to ourselves—forward
enough if it relates to others? If something is said reflecting on the
character of an intimate friend or near relative, how unwilling we are
to lend an ear to it, how we catch at every excuse or palliating
circumstance, and hold out against the clearest proof, while we instantly
believe any idle report against an enemy, magnify the commonest
trifles into crimes, and torture the evidence against him to our heart’s
content! Do not we change our opinion of the same person, and
make him out to be <em>black</em> or <em>white</em> according to the terms we happen
to be on? If we have a favourite author, do we not exaggerate his
beauties and pass over his defects, and <em>vice versâ</em>? The human mind
plays the interested advocate much oftener than the upright and
inflexible judge, in the colouring and relief it gives to the facts
brought before it. We believe things not more because they are true
or probable, than because we desire, or (if the imagination once takes
that turn) because we dread them. ‘Fear has more devils than vast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>hell can hold.’ The sanguine always hope, the gloomy always despond,
from temperament and not from forethought. Do we not disguise the
plainest facts from ourselves if they are disagreeable. Do we not
flatter ourselves with impossibilities? What girl does not look in the
glass to persuade herself she is handsome? What woman ever
believes herself old, or does not hate to be called so: though she knows
the exact year and day of her age, the more she tries to keep up the
appearance of youth to herself and others? What lover would ever
acknowledge a flaw in the character of his mistress, or would not
construe her turning her back on him into a proof of attachment?
The story of <em>January and May</em> is pat to our purpose; for the
credulity of mankind as to what touches our inclinations has been
proverbial in all ages: yet we are told that the mind is passive in
making up these wilful accounts, and is guided by nothing but the
<em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em> of evidence. Even in action and where we still may
determine by proper precaution the event of things, instead of being
compelled to shut our eyes to what we cannot help, we still are the dupes
of the feeling of the moment, and prefer amusing ourselves with fair
appearances to securing more solid benefits by a sacrifice of Imagination
and stubborn Will to Truth. The blindness of passion to the
most obvious and well known consequences is deplorable. There
seems to be a particular fatality in this respect. Because a thing is in
our power <em>till</em> we have committed ourselves, we appear to dally, to
trifle with, to make light of it, and to think it will still be in our
power <em>after</em> we have committed ourselves. Strange perversion of the
reasoning faculties, which is little short of madness, and which yet is
one of the constant and practical sophisms of human life! It is as
if one should say—I am in no danger from a tremendous machine
unless I touch such a spring and therefore I will approach it, I will
play with the danger, I will laugh at it, and at last in pure sport and
wantonness of heart, from my sense of previous security, I <em>will</em> touch
it—and <em>there’s an end</em>. While the thing remains in contemplation,
we may be said to stand safe and smiling on the brink: as soon as we
proceed to action we are drawn into the vortex of passion and hurried
to our destruction. A person taken up with some one purpose or
passion is intent only upon that: he drives out the thought of every
thing but its gratification: in the pursuit of that he is blind to consequences:
his first object being attained, they all at once, and as if by
magic, rush upon his mind. The engine recoils, he is caught in his
own snare. A servant-girl, for some pique, or for an angry word,
determines to poison her mistress. She knows before hand (just as
well as she does afterwards) that it is at least a hundred chances to
one she will be hanged if she succeeds, yet this has no more effect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>upon her than if she had never heard of any such matter. The only
idea that occupies her mind and hardens it against every other, is that
of the affront she has received, and the desire of revenge; she broods
over it; she meditates the mode, she is haunted with her scheme
night and day; it works like poison; it grows into a madness, and
she can have no peace till it is accomplished and <em>off her mind</em>; but the
moment this is the case, and her passion is assuaged, fear takes place
of hatred, the slightest suspicion alarms her with the certainty of her
fate from which she before wilfully averted her thoughts; she runs
wildly from the officers before they know any thing of the matter;
the gallows stares her in the face, and if none else accuses her, so
full is she of her danger and her guilt, that she probably betrays
herself. She at first would see no consequences to result from her
crime but the getting rid of a present uneasiness; she now sees the
very worst. The whole seems to depend on the turn given to the
imagination, on our immediate disposition to attend to this or that
view of the subject, the evil or the good. As long as our intention
is unknown to the world, before it breaks out into action, it seems to
be deposited in our own bosoms, to be a mere feverish dream, and to
be left with all its consequences under our imaginary control: but
no sooner is it realised and known to others, than it appears to have
escaped from our reach, we fancy the whole world are up in arms
against us, and vengeance is ready to pursue and overtake us. So in
the pursuit of pleasure, we see only that side of the question which
we approve: the disagreeable consequences (which may take place)
make no part of our intention or concern, or of the wayward
exercise of our will: if they should happen we cannot help it; they
form an ugly and unwished-for contrast to our favourite speculation:
we turn our thoughts another way, repeating the adage <i><span lang="la">quod sic mihi
ostendis incredulus odi</span></i>. It is a good remark in ‘Vivian Grey,’ that a
bankrupt walks the streets the day before his name is in the Gazette
with the same erect and confident brow as ever, and only feels the
mortification of his situation after it becomes known to others. Such
is the force of sympathy, and its power to take off the edge of
internal conviction! As long as we can impose upon the world, we
can impose upon ourselves, and trust to the flattering appearances,
though we know them to be false. We put off the evil day as long
as we can, make a jest of it as the certainty becomes more painful,
and refuse to acknowledge the secret to ourselves till it can no longer
be kept from all the world. In short, we believe just as little or as
much as we please of those things in which our will can be supposed
to interfere; and it is only by setting aside our own interests and
inclinations on more general questions that we stand any chance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>arriving at a fair and rational judgment. Those who have the largest
hearts have the soundest understandings; and he is the truest
philosopher who can forget himself. This is the reason why
philosophers are often said to be mad, for thinking only of the
abstract truth and of none of its worldly adjuncts,—it seems like an
absence of mind, or as if the devil had got into them! If belief
were not in some degree voluntary, or were grounded entirely on
strict evidence and absolute proof, every one would be a martyr to
his opinions, and we should have no power of evading or glossing
over those matter-of-fact conclusions for which positive vouchers could
be produced, however painful these conclusions might be to our own
feelings, or offensive to the prejudices of others.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>DEFINITION OF WIT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Wit is the putting together in jest, <em>i.e.</em> in fancy, or in bare supposition,
ideas between which there is a serious, <em>i.e.</em> a customary incompatibility,
and by this pretended union, or juxtaposition, to point out more
strongly some lurking incongruity. Or, wit is the dividing a sentence
or an object into a number of constituent parts, as suddenly and with
the same vivacity of apprehension to compound them again with other
objects, ‘wherein the most distant resemblance or the most partial
coincidence may be found.’ It is the <em>polypus</em> power of the mind, by
which a distinct life and meaning is imparted to the different parts of
a sentence or object after they are severed from each other; or it is
the prism dividing the simplicity and candour of our ideas into a parcel
of motley and variegated hues; or it is the mirror broken into pieces,
each fragment of which reflects a new light from surrounding objects;
or it is the untwisting the chain of our ideas, whereby each link is
made to hook on more readily to others than when they were all
bound up together by habit, and with a view to a <em>set</em> purpose. Ideas
exist as a sort of <em>fixtures</em> in the understanding; they are like <em>moveables</em>
(that will also unscrew and take to pieces) in the wit or fancy. If
our grave notions were always well founded; if there were no
aggregates of power, of prejudice, and absurdity; if the value and
importance of an object went on increasing with the opinion entertained
of it, and with the surrender of our faith, freedom, and every thing
else to aggrandise it, then ‘the squandering glances’ of the wit,
‘whereby the wise man’s folly is anatomised,’ would be as impertinent
as they would be useless. But while gravity and imposture not only
exist, but reign triumphant; while the proud, obstinate, sacred tumours
rear their heads on high, and are trying to get a new lease of for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>ever and a day; then oh! for the Frenchman’s art (‘Voltaire’s?—the
same’) to break the torpid spell, and reduce the bloated mass to
its native insignificance! When a Ferdinand still rules, seated on his
throne of darkness and blood, by English bayonets and by English
gold (that have no mind to remove him thence) who is not glad that
an Englishman has the wit and spirit to translate the title of <em>King
Ferdinand</em> into <em>Thing Ferdinand</em>; and does not regret that, instead of
pointing the public scorn and exciting an indignant smile, the stroke
of wit has not the power to shatter, to wither, and annihilate in its
lightning blaze the monstrous assumption, with all its open or covert
abettors? This would be a <em>set-off</em>, indeed, to the joint efforts of
pride, ignorance, and hypocrisy: as it is, wit plays its part, and does
not play it ill, though it is too apt to cut both ways. It may be said
that what I have just quoted is not an instance of the decomposition
of an idea or word into its elements, and finding a solid sense hid in
the unnoticed particles of wit, but is the addition of another element
or letter. But it was the same lively perception of individual and
salient points, that saw the word <span class='sc'>King</span> stuck up in capital letters, as it
were, and like a transparency in the <em>Illuminated Missal</em> of the Fancy,
that enabled the satirist to conjure up the letter T before it, and made
the transition (urged by contempt) easy. For myself, with all my
blind, rooted prejudices against the name, it would be long enough
before I should hit upon so happy a mode of expressing them. My
mind is not sufficiently alert and disengaged. I cannot run along the
letters composing it like the spider along its web, to see what they are
or how to combine them anew; I am crushed like the worm, and
writhing beneath the load. I can give no reasons for the faith that is
in me, unless I read a novel of Sir Walter’s, but there I find plenty
of examples to justify my hatred of kings in former times, and to
prevent my wishing to ‘revive the ancient spirit of loyalty’ in this!
Wit, then, according to this account of it, depends on the rapid
analysis or solution of continuity in our ideas, which, by detaching,
puts them into a condition to coalesce more readily with others, and
form new and unexpected combinations: but does all analysis imply
wit, or where is the difference? Does the examining the flowers and
leaves in the cover of a chair-bottom, or the several squares in a
marble pavement, constitute wit? Does looking through a microscope
amount to it? The painter analyses the face into features—nose,
eyes, and mouth—the features into their component parts: but this
process of observation and attention to details only leads him to discriminate
more nicely, and not to confound objects. The mathematician
<em>abstracts</em> in his reasonings, and considers the same line, now as forming
the side of a triangle, now of a square figure; but does he laugh at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>the discovery, or tell it to any one else as a monstrous good jest?
These questions require an answer; and an evasive one will not do.
With respect to the wit of words, the explanation is not difficult;
and if all wit were verbal, my task would be soon ended. For
language, being in its own nature arbitrary and ambiguous; or consisting
of ‘sounds significant,’ which are now applied to one thing,
now to something wholly different and unconnected, the most opposite
and jarring mixtures may be introduced into our ideas by making use of
this medium which looks two ways at once, either by applying the
same word to two different meanings, or by dividing it into several
parts, each probably the sign of a different thing, and which may
serve as the starting-post of a different set of associations. The very
circumstance which at first one might suppose would convert all the
world into punsters and word-catchers, and make a Babel and chaos
of language, <em>viz.</em> the arbitrary and capricious nature of the symbols it
uses, is that which prevents them from becoming so; for words not
being substantive things in themselves, and utterly valueless and
unimportant except as the index of thought, the mind takes no notice
of or lays no kind of stress upon them, passes on to what is to follow,
uses them mechanically and almost unconsciously; and thus the
syllables of which a word may be composed, are lost in its known
import, and the word itself in the general context. We may be said
neither to hear nor see the words themselves; we attend only to the
inference, the intention they are meant to communicate. This merging
of the sound in the sense, of the means in the end, both common
sense, the business of life, and the limitation of the human faculties
dictate. But men of wit and leisure are not contented with this; in
the discursiveness of their imaginations and with their mercurial
spirits, they find it an amusement to attend not only to the conclusion
or the meaning of words, but to criticise and have an eye to the words
themselves. Dull, plodding people go no farther than the literal, or
more properly, the practical sense; the parts of a word or phrase are
<em>massed together</em> in their habitual conceptions; their rigid understandings
are confined to the one meaning of any word predetermined by
its place in the sentence, and they are propelled forward to the end
without looking to the right or the left. The others, who are less
the creatures of habit and have a greater quantity of disposable activity,
take the same words out of harness, as it were, lend them wings, and
flutter round them in all sorts of fantastic combinations, and in every
direction that they choose to take. For instance: the word <em>elder</em>
signifies in the dictionary either <em>age</em> or a certain sort of <em>tree</em> or <em>berry</em>;
but if you mention <em>elder wine</em> all the other senses sink into the dictionary
as superfluous and nonsensical, and you think only of the wine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>which happens to bear this name. It required, therefore, a man of
Mr. Lamb’s wit and disdain of the ordinary trammels of thought, to
cut short a family dispute over some very excellent wine of this
description, by saying, ‘I wonder what it is that makes <em>elder wine</em> so
very pleasant, when <em>elder brothers</em> are so extremely disagreeable?’
<em>Compagnons du lys</em>, may mean either the <em>companions of the order of the
flower-de-luce</em>, or the <em>companions of Ulysses</em>—who were transformed into
swine—according as you lay the emphasis. The French wits, at the
restoration of Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span>, with admirable point and truth, applied it
in this latter sense. Two things may thus meet, in the casual construction
and artful encounters of language, wide as the poles asunder
and yet perfectly alike; and this is the perfection of wit, when the
physical sound is the same, the physical sense totally unlike, and the
moral sense absolutely identical. What is it that in things supplies
the want of the <em>double entendre</em> of language?—<span class='sc'>Absurdity.</span> And this
is the very signification of the term. For it is only when the two
contradictory natures are found in the same object that the verbal wit
holds good, and the real wit or <em>jeu d’esprit</em> exists and may be brought
out wherever this contradiction is obvious with or without the <em>jeu-de-mots</em>
to assist it. We can comprehend how the evolving or disentangling
an unexpected coincidence, hid under the same name, is full
of ambiguity and surprise; but an absurdity may be written on the
face of a thing without the help of language; and it is in detecting
and embodying this that the finest wit lies. Language is merely one
instrument or handle that forwards the operation: Fancy is the
midwife of wit. But how?—If we look narrowly and attentively,
we shall find that there is a language of things as well as words, and
the same variety of meaning, a hidden and an obvious, a partial and a
general one, in both the one and the other. For things, any more
than words, are not detached, independent existences, but are connected
and cohere together by habit and circumstances in certain sets
of association, and consist of an alphabet, which is thus formed into
words and regular propositions, which being once done and established
as the understood order of the world, the particular ideas are either
not noticed, or <em>determined</em> to a set purpose and ‘foregone conclusion,’
just as the letters of a word are sunk in the word, or the different
possible meanings of a word adjusted by the context. One part of an
object being habitually associated with others, or one object with a
set of other objects, we <em>lump</em> the whole together, take the general rule
for granted, and merge the details in a blind and confused idea of the
aggregate result. This, then, is the province of wit; to penetrate
through the disguise or crust with which indolence and custom ‘skin
and slur over’ our ideas, to move this slough of prejudice, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>resolve these aggregates or bundles of things into their component
parts by a more lively and unshackled conception of their distinctions,
and the possible combinations of these, so as to throw a glancing and
fortuitous light upon the whole. There is then, it is obvious, a
<em>double meaning</em> in things or ideas as well as in words (each being
ordinarily regarded by the mind merely as the mechanical signs or
links to hold together other ideas connected with them)—and it is in
detecting this <em>double meaning</em> that wit in either case is shown. Having
no books at hand to refer to for examples, and in the dearth of
imagination which I naturally labour under, I must look round the
room in search of illustrations. I see a number of stars or diamond
figures in the carpet, with the violent contrast of red and yellow and
fantastic wreaths of flowers twined round them, without being able to
extract either edification or a particle of amusement from them: a
joint-stool and a fire-screen in a corner are equally silent on the subject—the
first hint I receive (or glimmering of light) is from a pair of
tongs which, placed formally astride on the fender, bear a sort of
resemblance to the human figure called <em>long legs and no body</em>. The
absurdity is not in the tongs (for that is their usual shape) but in the
human figure which has borrowed a likeness foreign to itself. With
this <em>contre-sens</em>, and the uneasiness and confusion in our habitual ideas
which it excites, and the effort to clear up this by throwing it from us
into a totally distinct class of objects, where by being made plain and
palpable, it is proved to have nothing to do with that into which it has
obtruded itself, and to which it makes pretensions, commences the
operation of wit and the satisfaction it yields to the mind. This I
think is the cause of the delightful nature of wit, and of its relieving,
instead of aggravating, the pains of defect or deformity, by pointing it
out in the most glaring colours, inasmuch as by so doing, we, as it
were, completely detach the peccant part and restore the sense of
propriety which, in its undetected and unprobed state, it was beginning
to disturb. It is like taking a grain of sand out of the eye, a thorn out
of the foot. We have discharged our mental reckoning, and had our
revenge. Thus, when we say of a <em>snub-nose</em>, that it is like an ace of
clubs, it is less out of spite to the individual than to vindicate and
place beyond a doubt the propriety of our notions of form in general.
Butler compares the knight’s red, formal-set beard to a tile:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘In cut and die so like a tile,</div>
      <div class='line'>A sudden view it would beguile;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>we laugh in reading this, but the triumph is less over the wretched precisian
than it is the triumph of common sense. So Swift exclaims:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The house of brother Van I spy,</div>
      <div class='line'>In shape resembling a goose-pie.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>Here, if the satire was just, the characteristics of want of solidity, of
incongruity, and fantastical arrangement were inherent in the building,
and written on its front to the discerning eye, and only required to be
brought out by the simile of the goose-pie, which is an immediate test
and illustration (being an extreme case) of those qualities. The
absurdity, which before was either admired, or only suspected, now
stands revealed, and is turned into a laughing stock, by the new
version of the building into a goose-pie (as much as if the metamorphosis
had been effected by a play of words, combining the most
opposite things), for the mind in this case having narrowly escaped
being imposed upon by taking a trumpery edifice for a stately pile,
and perceiving the cheat, naturally wishes to cut short the dispute by
finding out the most discordant object possible, and nicknames the
building after it. There can be no farther question whether a goose-pie
is a fine building. Butler compares the sun rising after the dark
night to a lobster boiled, and ‘turned from black to red.’ This is
equally mock-wit and mock-poetry, as the sun can neither be exalted
nor degraded by the comparison. It is a play upon the ideas, like
what we see in a play upon words, without meaning. In a pantomime
at Sadler’s Wells, some years ago, they improved upon this hint, and
threw a young chimney-sweeper into a cauldron of boiling water, who
came out a smart, dapper volunteer. This was <em>practical wit</em>; so that
wit may exist not only without the play upon words, but even without
the use of them. Hogarth may be cited as an instance, who abounds
in wit almost as much as he does in humour, considering the inaptitude
of the language he used, or in those double allusions which throw a
reflected light upon the same object, according to Collins’s description
of wit,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like jewels in his crisped hair.’</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Mark Supple’s calling out from the Gallery of the House of Commons—‘A
song from Mr. Speaker!’ when Addington was in the chair
and there was a pause in the debate, was undoubtedly wit, though the
relation of any such absurd circumstance actually taking place, would
only have been humour. A gallant calling on a courtesan (for it is
fair to illustrate these intricacies how we can) observed, ‘he should
only make her a present every other time.’ She answered, ‘Then
come only every other time.’ This appears to me to offer a sort of
touchstone to the question. The sense here is, ‘Don’t come unless
you pay.’ There is no wit in this: the wit then consists in the mode
of conveying the hint: let us see into what this resolves itself. The
object is to point out as strongly as can be, the absurdity of not paying;
and in order to do this, an impossibility is assumed by running a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>parallel on the phrases, ‘paying every other time,’ and ‘coming every
other time,’ as if the coming went for nothing without paying, and
thus, by the very contrast and contradiction in the terms, showing the
most perfect contempt for the literal coming, of which the essence,
viz. paying, was left out. It is, in short, throwing the most killing
scorn upon, and fairly annihilating the coming without paying, as if it
were possible to come and not to come at the same time, by virtue of
an identical proposition or form of speech applied to contrary things.
The wit so far, then, consists in suggesting, or insinuating indirectly,
an apparent coincidence between two things, to make the real incongruity,
by the recoil of the imagination, more palpable than it could
have been without this feigned and artificial approximation to an union
between them. This makes the difference between jest and earnest,
which is essential to all wit. It is only <em>make-believe</em>. It is a false
pretence set up, or the making one thing pass in supposition for
another, as a foil to the truth when the mask is removed. There
need not be laughter, but there must be deception and surprise:
otherwise, there can be no wit. When Archer, in order to bind the
robbers, suddenly makes an excuse to call out to Dorinda, ‘Pray lend
me your garter, Madam,’ this is both witty and laughable. Had
there been any propriety in the proposal or chance of compliance with
it, it would no longer have been a joke: had the question been quite
absurd and uncalled-for, it would have been mere impudence and
folly; but it is the mixture of sense and nonsense, that is, the pretext
for the request in the fitness of a garter to answer the purpose in
question, and the totally opposite train of associations between a lady’s
garter (particularly in the circumstances which had just happened in
the play) and tying a rascally robber’s hands behind his back, that
produces the delightful <em>equivoque</em> and unction of the passage in
Farquhar. It is laughable, because the train of inquiry it sets in
motion is at once on pleasant and on forbidden ground. We did not
laugh in the former case—‘Then only come every other time’—because
it was a mere ill-natured exposure of an absurdity, and there
was an end of it: but here, the imagination courses up and down
along a train of ideas, by which it is alternately repelled and attracted,
and this produces the natural drollery or inherent ludicrousness. It
is the difference between the wit of humour and the wit of sense.
Once more, suppose you take a stupid, unmeaning likeness of a face,
and throwing a wig over it, stick it on a peg, to make it look like a
barber’s block—this is wit without words. You give that which is
stupid in itself the additional accompaniments of what is still more
stupid, to enhance and verify the idea by a falsehood. We know the
head so placed is not a barber’s block; but it might, we see, very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>well pass for one. This is caricature or the <em>grotesque</em>. The face
itself might be made infinitely laughable, and great humour be shown
in the delineation of character: it is in combining this with other
artificial and aggravating circumstances, or in the setting of this piece
of lead that the wit appears.<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c008'><sup>[62]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Recapitulation.</span> It is time to stop
short in this list of digressions, and try to join the scattered threads
together. We are too apt, both from the nature of language and the
turn of modern philosophy, which reduces every thing to simple
sensations, to consider whatever bears one name as one thing in itself,
which prevents our ever properly understanding those <em>mixed modes</em> and
various clusters of ideas, to which almost all language has a reference.
Thus if we regard <em>wit</em> as something resembling a drop of quicksilver,
or a spangle from off a cloak, a little nimble substance, that is pointed
and glitters (we do not know how) we shall make no progress in
analysing its varieties or its essence; it is a mere word or an atom:
but if we suppose it to consist in, or be the result of, several sets and
sorts of ideas combined together or acting upon each other (like the
tunes and machinery of a barrel-organ) we may stand some chance of
explaining and getting an insight into the process. Wit is not, then,
a single idea or object, but it is one mode of viewing and representing
nature, or the differences and similitudes, harmonies and discords in
the links and chains of our ideas of things at large. If all our ideas
were literal, physical, confined to a single impression of the object,
there could be no faculty for, or possibility of, the existence of wit,
for its first principle is <em>mocking</em> or making a jest of anything, and its
first condition or postulate, therefore, is the distinction between jest
and earnest. First of all, wit implies a jest, that is, the bringing
forward a pretended or counterfeit illustration of a thing; which,
being presently withdrawn, makes the naked truth more apparent by
contrast. It is lessening and undermining our faith in any thing (in
which the serious consists) by heightening or exaggerating the vividness
of our idea of it, so as by carrying it to extremes to show the error
in the first concoction, and from a received practical truth and object
of grave assent, to turn it into a laughing stock to the fancy. This
will apply to Archer and the lady’s garter, which is ironical: but
how does it connect with the comparison of Hudibras’s beard to a tile,
which is only an exaggeration; or the <em>Compagnons d’Ulysse</em>, which is
meant for a literal and severe truth, as well as a play upon words?
More generally then, wit is the conjuring up in the fancy any illustration
of an idea by likeness, combination of other images, or by a
form of words, that being intended to point out the <em>eccentricity</em> or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>departure of the original idea from the class to which it belongs does
so by referring it contingently and obliquely to a totally opposite class,
where the surprise and mere possibility of finding it, proves the inherent
want of congruity. Hudibras’s beard is transformed (by wit) into a
tile: a strong man is transformed (by imagination) into a tower.
The objects, you will say, are unlike in both cases; yet the comparison
in one case is meant seriously, in the other it is merely to tantalize.
The imagination is serious, even to passion, and exceeds truth by
laying a greater stress on the object; wit has no feeling but contempt,
and exceeds truth to make light of it. In a poetical comparison there
cannot be a sense of incongruity or surprise; in a witty one there
must. The reason is this: It is granted stone is not flesh, a tile
is not hair, but the associated feelings are alike, and naturally coalesce
in one instance, and are discordant and only forced together by a trick
of style in the other. But how can that be, if the objects occasioning
these feelings are equally dissimilar?—Because the qualities of stiffness
or squareness and colour, objected to in Hudibras’s beard, are themselves
peculiarities and oddities in a beard, or contrary to the nature
or to our habitual notion of that class of objects; and consequently
(not being natural or rightful properties of a beard) must be found in
the highest degree in, and admit of, a grotesque and irregular comparison
with a class of objects, of which squareness and redness<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c008'><sup>[63]</sup></a> are the
essential characteristics (as of a tile), and which can have, accordingly,
no common point of union in general qualities or feeling with the first
class, but where the ridicule must be just and pointed from this very
circumstance, that is, from the coincidence in that one particular only,
which is the flaw and singularity of the first object. On the other
hand, size and strength, which are the qualities on which the comparison
of a man to a tower hinges, are not repugnant to the general
constitution of man, but familiarly associated with our ideas of him:
so that there is here no sense of impropriety in the object, nor of
incongruity or surprise in the comparison: all is grave and decorous,
and instead of burlesque, bears the aspect of a loftier truth. But if
strength and magnitude fall within our ordinary contemplations of man
as things not out of the course of nature, whereby he is enabled, with
the help of imagination, to rival a tower of brass or stone, are not
littleness and weakness the counterpart of these, and subject to the
same rule? What shall we say, then, to the comparison of a dwarf
to a pigmy, or to Falstaff’s comparison of <em>Silence</em> to ‘a forked radish,
or a man made after supper of a cheese-paring?’ Once more then,
strength and magnitude are qualities which impress the imagination in
a powerful and substantive manner; if they are an excess above the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>ordinary or average standard, it is an excess to which we lend a ready
and admiring belief, that is, we <em>will</em> them to be if they are not,
because they <em>ought to be</em>—whereas, in the other case of peculiarity and
defect, the mind is constantly at war with the impression before it;
our affections do not tend that way; we will it <em>not</em> to be; reject,
detach, and discard it from the object as much and as far as possible;
and therefore it is, that there being no voluntary coherence but a
constant repugnance between the peculiarity (as of <em>squareness</em>) and
the object (as a <em>beard</em>), the idea of a beard as being both naturally
and properly of a certain form and texture remains as remote as ever
from that of a tile; and hence the double problem is solved, why the
mind is at once surprised and not shocked by the allusion; for first,
the mind being made to see a beard so unlike a beard, is glad to have
the discordance increased and put beyond controversy, by comparing
it to something still more unlike one, <em>viz.</em>, a tile; and secondly,
<em>squareness</em> never having been admitted as a desirable and accredited
property of a beard as it is of a tile, by which the two classes of
ideas might have been reconciled and compromised (like those of a
man and a tower) through a feeling or quality common (in will) to
both, the transition from one to the other continues as new and
startling, that is, as witty as ever;—<em>which was to be demonstrated</em>. I
think I see my way clearly so far. Wit consists in two things, the
perceiving the incongruity between an object and the class to which it
generally belongs, and secondly, the pointing out or making this
incongruity more manifest, by transposing it to a totally different
class of objects in which it is prescriptively found in perfection. The
medium or link of connexion between the opposite classes of ideas is
in the unlikeness of one of the things in question <em>to itself</em>, <em>i.e.</em> the class
it belongs to: this peculiarity is the narrow bridge or line along which
the fancy runs to link it to a set of objects in all other respects different
from the first, and having no sort of communication, either in fact
or inclination, with it, and in which the pointedness and brilliancy, or
the <em>surprise</em> and <em>contrast</em> of wit consists. The faculty by which this
is done is the rapid, careless decomposition and recomposition of our
ideas, by means of which we easily and clearly detach certain links in
the chain of our associations from the place where they stand, and
where they have an infirm footing, and join them on to others, to
show how little intimacy they had with the former set.</p>

<p class='c007'>The motto of wit seems to be, <em>Light come, light go</em>. A touch is
sufficient to dissever what already hangs so loose as folly, like froth on
the surface of the wave; and an hyperbole, an impossibility, a pun or
a nickname will push an absurdity, which is close upon the verge of
it, over the precipice. It is astonishing how much wit or laughter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>there is in the world—it is one of the staple commodities of daily life—and
yet, being excited by what is <em>out of the way</em> and singular, it
ought to be rare, and gravity should be the order of the day. Its
constant recurrence from the most trifling and trivial causes, shows
that the contradiction is less to what we find things than to what we
wish them to be. A circle of milliner’s-girls laugh all day long at
nothing, or day after day at the same things—the same cant phrase
supplies the wags of the town with wit for a month—the same set of
nicknames has served the <cite>John Bull</cite> and <em>Blackwood’s Magazine</em> ever
since they started. It would appear by this that its essence consisted
in monotony, rather than variety. Some kind of incongruity however
seems inseparable from it, either in the object or language. For
instance, admiration and flattery become wit by being expressed in a
quaint and abrupt way. Thus, when the dustman complimented the
Duchess of Devonshire by saying, as she passed, ‘I wish that lady
would let me light my pipe at her eyes,’ nothing was meant less than
to ridicule or throw contempt, yet the speech was wit and not serious
flattery. The putting a wig on a stupid face and setting it on a
barber’s pole is wit or humour:—the fixing a pair of wings on a
beautiful figure to make it look more like an angel is poetry; so that
the <em>grotesque</em> is either serious or ludicrous, as it professes to exalt or
degrade. Whenever any thing is proposed to be <em>done</em> in the way of
wit, it must be in mockery or jest; since if it were a probable or
becoming action, there would be no drollery in suggesting it; but this
does not apply to illustrations by comparison, there is here no line
drawn between what is to take place and what is not to take place—they
must only be extreme and unexpected. Mere nonsense, however,
is not wit. For however slight the connexion, it will never do
to have none at all; and the more fine and fragile it is in some
respects, the more close and deceitful it should be in the particular
one insisted on. Farther, mere sense is not wit. Logical subtilty or
ingenuity does not amount to wit (although it may mimic it) without
an immediate play of fancy, which is a totally different thing. The
comparing the phrenologist’s division of the same portion of the brain
into the organs of form and colour to the cutting a Yorkshire pudding
into two parts, and calling the one <em>custard</em> and the other <em>plum-cake</em>
may pass for wit with some, but not with me. I protest (if required)
against having a grain of wit.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c008'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Many persons are surprised at the conduct of Charles <span class='fss'>X.</span> in pushing
things to extremities: the wonder would have been, if he had not.
All the time of the <em>Restoration</em> under a charter, he was employed in
thinking how to get rid of that charter, to throw off that incubus, to
cancel that juggle, to breathe once more the air of divine right. Till
this were done—no matter by what delays, after what length of time,
by what jesuitical professions, by what false oaths, by what stratagems,
by what unmasked insolence, by what loud menaces, by what violence,
by what blood—the French monarch (whether Charles or Louis),
felt himself ‘cooped, confined, and cabined in, by saucy doubts and
fears;’ but this phantom of a constitution once out of the way he
would be ‘himself again.’ He would then first cry <em>Vive la Charte!</em>
without a pang—with his eyes running over, and his heart bursting with
laughter. If he had a right to be <em>where</em> he was, he had a right to be
<em>what</em> he was, and what he was born to be. This was the first idea
instilled into his mind, the last he would forget. All else was a compromise
with circumstances, a base surrender of an inalienable claim,
a concession extorted under <em>duresse</em>, so much the more eagerly to be
retracted, as an appearance of compliance had been the longer and
more studiously kept up. A throne not founded on inherent right
was a mockery and insult. All power shared with the people, supposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>to be derived from them, for which the possessor was accountable
to them, held during pleasure or good behaviour, was pollution to
his thoughts, odious to him as the leprosy. Be sure of this, popular
right coiled round the sceptre of hereditary kings is like the viper
clinging to our hands, which we shake off with fear and loathing.
There is in despots (born and bred) a natural and irreconcilable
antipathy to the people, and to all obligations to them. The very
name of freedom is a screech-owl in their ears. They have been
brought up with the idea that they were entitled to absolute power,
that there was something in their blood that gave them a right to it
without condition or reserve, or being called to account for the use or
abuse of it; and they reject with scorn and impatience anything
short of this. They will either be absolute or they will be nothing.
The Bourbons for centuries had been regarded as the gods of the earth,
as a superior race of beings, who had a sovereign right to trample on
mankind, and crush them in their wrath or spare them in their mercy.
Would Charles <span class='fss'>X.</span> derogate from his ancestors, would he be the
degenerate scion of that royal line, to wear a tarnished and dishonoured
crown, to be raised by the shout of a mob, to wait the assent of a
Chamber of Deputies, to owe every thing to the people, to be a king
on liking and on sufferance, a sort of state prisoner in his own
kingdom, shut up and spell-bound in the nickname of a Constitution?
He would as soon consent to go on all-fours. The latter would not
shock his pride and prejudices more: would not be a greater degradation
in his eyes, or a more total inversion of the order of nature. It
is not that the successor to a despotic throne will not, but he cannot
be the king of a free people: the very supposition is in his mind a contradiction
in terms. It is something base and mechanical, not amounting
even to the rank of a private gentleman who does what he pleases
with his estate; and kings consider mankind as their estate. If a
herd of overloaded asses were to turn against their drivers and demand
their liberty and better usage, these could not be more astonished
than the Bourbons were when the French people turned against them
and demanded their rights. Will these same Bourbons, who have been
rocked and cradled in the notion of arbitrary power, and of their own
exclusive privileges as a separate and sacred race, who have sucked
it in with their mothers’ milk, who inherit it in their blood, who
have nursed it in exile and in solitude, and gloated over it once more,
since their return, as within their reach, ever be brought to look Liberty
in the face except as a mortal and implacable foe, or ever give up the
hope of removing that obstacle to all that they have been or still have
a fancied right to be? The last thing that they can be convinced of
will be to make them comprehend that they are <em>men</em>. This is a discovery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>of the last forty years, that has been forced upon them in no
very agreeable manner; by the beheading of more than one of their
race, the banishment of the rest, by their long wanderings and
unwelcome return to their own country, from whence they have
been driven twice since—but up to that period they find no such
levelling doctrine inscribed either in the records of history or on
their crest and coat of arms or in the forms of religion or in the
ancient laws and institutions of the kingdom. Which version will
they then believe or turn a deaf ear to: that which represents them
as God’s vicegerents upon earth, or that which holds them up as
the enemies of the human race and the scoff and outcasts of their
country? Every, the meanest individual has a standard of estimation
in his own breast, which is that he is of more importance than all the
rest of the world put together; but a king is the only person with
respect to whom all the rest of the world join or have ever joined in the
same conclusion; and be assured that having encouraged him in this
opinion, he will do every thing in his power to keep them to it till his
last gasp. You have sworn to a man that he is a god: this is indeed
the most solemn of compacts. Any attempt to infringe it, any breath
throwing a doubt upon it, is treason, rebellion, impiety. Would you
be so unjust as to retract the boon, he will not be so unjust to himself
as to let you. He would sooner suffer ten deaths and forfeit twenty
kingdoms than patiently submit to the indignity of having his right
called in question. It is said, Charles <span class='fss'>X.</span> is a good-natured man: it
may be so, and that he would not hurt a fly; but in that quarrel he
would shed the blood of millions of men. If he did not do so, he would
consider himself as dead to honour, a recreant to fame, and a traitor
to the cause of kings. Touch but that string, the inborn dignity of
kings and their title to ‘solely sovereign sway and masterdom,’ and the
milk of human kindness in the best-natured monarch turns to gall and
bitterness. You might as well present a naked sword to his breast,
as be guilty of a word or look that can bear any other construction than
that of implicit homage and obedience. There is a spark of pride lurking
at the bottom of his heart, however glozed over by smiles and fair
speeches, ever ready (with the smallest opposition to his will) to
kindle into a flame, and desolate kingdoms. Let but the voice of freedom
speak, and to resist ‘shall be in him remorse, what bloody work
soever’ be the consequence. Good-natured kings, like good-natured
men, are often merely lovers of their own ease who give themselves
no trouble about other people’s affairs: but interfere in the slightest
point with their convenience, interest, or self-love, and a tigress is not
more furious in defence of her young. While the Royal Guards
were massacring the citizens of Paris, Charles <span class='fss'>X.</span> was partridge-shooting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>at St. Cloud, to show that the shooting of his subjects and the
shooting of game were equally among the <em>menus plaisirs</em> of royalty.
This is what is meant by mild paternal sway, by the perfection of a good-natured
monarch, when he orders the destruction of as great a number
of people as will not do what he pleases, without any discomposure
of dress or features. Away with such trifling! There is no
end of the confusion and mischief occasioned by the application of this
mode of arguing from personal character and appearances to public
measures and principles. If we are to believe the fashionable cant on
this subject, a man cannot do a dirty action because he wears a clean
shirt: he cannot break an oath to a nation, because he pays a gambling
debt; and because he is delighted with the universal homage that is paid
him, with having every luxury and every pomp at his disposal, he cannot,
under the mask of courtesy and good humour, conceal designs against
a Constitution, or ‘smile and smile and be a <em>tyrant</em>!’ Such is the
logic of the <cite>Times</cite>. This paper, ‘ever strong upon the stronger
side,’ laughs to scorn the very idea entertained by our ‘restless and
mercurial neighbours’ (as if the <cite>Times</cite> had nothing of the <em>tourniquet</em>
principle in its composition) that so amiable, so well-meaning and
prosperous a gentleman as Charles <span class='fss'>X.</span> should nourish an old and inveterate
grudge against the liberties of his country or wish to overturn that
happy order of things which the <cite>Times</cite> had so great a share in
establishing. But he no sooner verifies the predictions of the French
journalists and is tumbled from his throne, than the <cite>Times</cite> with its
jolly, swaggering, <em>thrasonical</em> air falls upon him and calls him all the
<em>vagabonds</em> it can get its tongue to. We do not see the wit of this,
any more than of its assuring us, with unabated confidence, that
there is not the least shadow of foundation for the apprehensions of
those who are perverse enough to think, that a Ministry that have
set up and countenanced the Continental despotisms, and uniformly
shown themselves worse than indifferent to the blood and groans of
thousands of victims in foreign countries (sacrificed under their guarantee
of the <em>deliverance of mankind</em>) may have an <em>arrière-pensée</em> against
the liberties of their own. We grant the premises of the <cite>Times</cite> in
either case, that the French king was good-humoured and that the Duke
has a vacant face; but these favourable appearances have not prevented
a violent catastrophe in the one case and may not in the other.
Mr. Brougham a short time ago, in a speech at a public meeting, gave
his hearty approbation of the late Revolution in France, and clenched
his argument by asking what fate an English monarch would merit, and
probably meet, who acted in the same manner as the besotted Charles;
who annulled the liberty of the press, who prevented the meeting of
the representatives of the people, who disfranchised four-fifths of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>electors by an arbitrary decree, and proposed to reign without law, and
raise the taxes without a Parliament? This is not exactly the point
at issue. A more <em>home</em> question would be, what fate a king of
England would deserve, not who did or attempted all this in his own
person, but who fearing to do that, as the next best thing and to show
which way his inclinations tended, aided and abetted with all
the might and resources of a people calling itself free, and tried
to force back upon a neighbouring state, by a long and cruel war
and with the ruin of his own subjects, a king like Charles <span class='fss'>X.</span>, who
by every act and circumstance of his life had shown himself hostile to
the welfare and freedom of his country, and whose conduct, if
repeated here, would justly incur the forfeiture of his own crown? It
would be ‘premature,’ in the judgment of some, to give an opinion on
this subject till after the thing has happened, and then it would be
neither loyal nor patriotic to condemn the conduct of our own
cabinet; but we hope at least that the next time the English government
undertake to force a king upon the French people, they will
send them a baboon instead of a Bourbon, as the less insult of the
two!—To return to the question of <em>personal politics</em>. Our last king
but one was a good domestic character; but this had little or nothing
to do with the wisdom or folly of his public measures. He might be
faithful to his conjugal vows, but might put a construction on some
clause in his Coronation-oath fatal to the peace and happiness of a
large part of his subjects. He might be an exceedingly well-meaning,
moral man, but might have notions instilled into him in early youth
respecting the prerogatives of the crown and the relation between the
sovereign and the people, that might not quit him to his latest breath,
and might embroil his subjects and the world in disastrous wars and
controversies during his whole reign. His son succeeded him without
the same reputation for domestic virtue, but adopted all the measures
of his father’s ministers. If the private character and the public conduct
were to be submitted to the same test, this could not have happened.
But the late king was cried up for his elegant accomplishments, and
as the <em>fine gentleman</em> of his family; and this, with equally sound
logic, atoned for the absence of less shewy qualities, and stamped his
public proceedings with the character of a wise and liberal policy.
We are already assured of a fortunate and peaceful reign, because the
present king looks pleased and good-humoured on his accession to the
crown; though the smallest cloud in the political horizon may
scatter the ruddy smiles and overcast the whole prospect. Mr.
Coleridge complains, somewhere, of politicians who pretend to guide
the state, and yet have ruined their own affairs. Would the author
of the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite> apply the same rule to other things, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>affirm that no one could be a poet or a philosopher who had not made
his fortune? One would suppose, that all the people of sense and
worth were confessedly on one side of the question in the great
disputes in religion or politics that have agitated and torn the world
in pieces, and all the knaves and fools on the other. This is hardly
tenable ground. Charles <span class='fss'>IX.</span>, of happy memory was we believe a
good-tempered man and a most religious prince: this did not hinder
him from authorising the massacre of St. Bartholomew and shooting
at the Huguenots out of the palace-windows with his own hands. This
was the prejudice of his time: we have still certain prejudices to contend
with in ours, which have nothing to do with the looks, temper,
or private character of those who hold them. We wonder at the
cruelties and atrocities of religious fanatics in former times, and would
not have them repeated: were none of these persecutors honest, conscientious
men? Take any twelve inquisitors: six of them shall be
angels and the other six scoundrels, yet they will all agree in one unanimous
verdict, condemning you or me to the flames for not believing
in the infallibility of the Pope. This is the thing to be avoided <em>by
all means</em>; and not to lose our time in idle discussions about the
amiableness of the characters of these pious exterminators, nor in
admiring the fineness of their countenances, nor the picturesque effect
of the scenery and <em>costume</em>. Charles <span class='fss'>X.</span>, the gay and gallant Count
d’Artois, wears a hair-shirt, is fond of partridge-shooting, and wanted
to put a yoke on the necks of his subjects. The last is that on
which issue was joined. Let him go where he chooses, with a handsome
pension; but let him not be sent back again (as he was once
before) at the expense of millions of lives!<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c008'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>EMANCIPATION OF THE JEWS</h2>
</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Player.</em> We have reformed that indifferently, my lord.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Hamlet.</em> Oh! reform it altogether.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The emancipation of the Jews is but a natural step in the progress of
civilisation. Laws and institutions are positive things: opinions and
sentiments are variable; and it is in conforming the stubbornness and
perversity of the former to the freedom and boldness of the latter,
that the harmony and beauty of the social order consist. But it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>said, ‘The Jews at present have few grievances to complain of; they
are well off, and should be thankful for the indulgence they receive.’
It is true, we no longer burn them at a stake, or plunder them of their
goods: why then continue to insult and fix an idle stigma on them?
At Rome a few years ago they made the Jews run races (naked) in
the Corso on Good Friday. At present, they only oblige them to
provide asses to run races on the same day for the amusement of the
populace, and to keep up the spirit of the good old custom, though by
altering it they confess that the custom was wrong, and that they are
ashamed of it. They also shut up the Jews in a particular quarter of
the city (called Il Ghetto Judaico), and at the same time will not
suffer the English as heretics to be buried within the walls of Rome.
An Englishman smiles or is scandalised at both these instances of
bigotry; but if he is asked, ‘Why, then, do you not yourselves
emancipate the Catholics and the Jews?’ he may answer, ‘We <em>have</em>
emancipated the one.’ And why not the other? ‘Because we are
intolerant.’ This and this alone is the reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>We throw in the teeth of the Jews that they are prone to certain
sordid vices. If they are vicious it is we who have made them so.
Shut out any class of people from the path to fair fame, and you
reduce them to grovel in the pursuit of riches and the means to live.
A man has long been in dread of insult for no just cause, and you
complain that he grows reserved and suspicious. You treat him with
obloquy and contempt, and wonder that he does not walk by you
with an erect and open brow.</p>

<p class='c007'>We also object to their trades and modes of life; that is, we shut
people up in close confinement and complain that they do not live in
the open air. The Jews barter and sell commodities, instead of
raising or manufacturing them. But this is the necessary traditional
consequence of their former persecution and pillage by all nations.
They could not set up a trade when they were hunted every moment
from place to place, and while they could count nothing their own
but what they could carry with them. They could not devote themselves
to the pursuit of agriculture, when they were not allowed to
possess a foot of land. You tear people up by the roots and trample
on them like noxious weeds, and then make an outcry that they do
not take root in the soil like wholesome plants. You drive them like
a pest from city to city, from kingdom to kingdom, and then call
them vagabonds and aliens.</p>

<p class='c007'>When reason fails, the Christian religion is, as usual, called in aid
of persecution. The admission of the Jews, it is said, to any place
of trust or emolument in the state ought not to be sanctioned, because
they expect the coming of the Messiah, and their restoration, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>day or other, to their own country: and Christianity, it is said, is
part of the law of the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to their exclusion because they expect the coming of the
Messiah, and their restoration, one day or other, to their own country,
a few words will be sufficient. Even if it is too much for a people,
with this reversion in the promised land, to have a ‘stake in the
country’ added to it; and the offer of a seat in the House of
Commons is too much for any one who looks forward to a throne in
the <em>New Jerusalem</em>: this objection comes with but an ill grace from
the followers of him who has declared, ‘My kingdom is not of this
world;’ and who on that plea profess to keep all the power and
authority in their own hands. Suppose an attempt were made to
exclude Christians from serving the office of constable, jury-man, or
knight of the shire, as expressly contrary to the great principle of
their religion, which inculcates an entire contempt for the things of
this life, and a constant preparation for a better. Would not this be
considered as an irony, and not a very civil one? Yet it is the
precise counterpart of this argument. The restoration of the Jews to
their own country, however firmly believed in as an article of faith,
has been delayed eighteen hundred years, and may be delayed eighteen
hundred more. Are they to remain indifferent to the good or evil,
to the respectability or odium that may attach to them all this while?
The world in general do not look so far; and the Jews have not
been accused, more than others, of sacrificing the practical to the
speculative. But according to this objection, there can be no amalgamation
of interests with a people of such fantastic principles and
abstracted ties; they cannot care how soon a country goes to ruin,
which they are always on the point of quitting. Suppose a Jew to
have amassed a large fortune in the last war, and to have laid by
money in the funds, and built himself a handsome house in the neighbourhood
of the metropolis; would he be more likely by his vote in
the House of Commons to promote a revolution, so as to cause
a general bankruptcy; or to encourage the mob to pull down his
house, or root up his favourite walks, because after all, at the end of
several centuries, he and the rest of his nation indulge in the prospect
of returning to their own country? The most clear-sighted John
Bull patriotism hardly reaches beyond ourselves and our heirs.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the assertion that Christianity is part of the law of the land,
as Popery is a part of the law of the land at Rome, and a good
reason for hunting Jews and refusing Christian burial to Protestants,
by whom is it made? Not by our Divines. They do not distrust
the power of our religion; and they will tell you that if Christianity,
as sanctioning these cruelties or any miserable remnant of them, is part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>of the law of the land, then the law of the land is no part of
Christianity. They do not forget the original character of the
Jewish people, and will not say anything against it. We and modern
Europe derived from them the whole germ of our civilisation, our
ideas on the unity of the Deity, or marriage, on morals,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And pure religion breathing household Laws.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The great founder of the Christian religion was himself born
among that people, and if the Jewish Nation are still to be branded
with his death, it might be asked on what principle of justice ought
we to punish men for crimes committed by their co-religionists near
two thousand years ago? That the Jews, as a people, persist in their
blindness and obstinacy is to be lamented; but it is at least, under the
circumstances, a proof of their sincerity; and as adherents to a losing
cause, they are entitled to respect and not contempt. Is it the
language of Lawyers? They are too intelligent, and, in the present
times, not favourers of hypocrisy. They know that this law is not
on our statute book, and if it were, that it would be law as long as it
remained there and no longer; they know that the supposition
originated in the unadvised dictum of a Judge, and, if it had been
uttered by a Puritan Divine, it would have been quoted at this day as
a specimen of puritanical nonsense and bigotry. Religion cannot take
on itself the character of law without ceasing to be religion; nor can
law recognise the obligations of religion for its principles, nor become
the pretended guardian and protector of the faith, without degenerating
into inquisitorial tyranny.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proposal to admit Jews to a seat in Parliament in this country
is treated as an irony or a burlesque on the Catholic question. At the
same time, it is said to be very proper and rational in France and
America, Denmark and the Netherlands, because there, though
they are nominally admitted, court influence excludes them in the
one, and popular opinion in the other, so that the law is of no avail:
that is, in other words, in England as there is neither court influence
nor popular prejudice; and as every thing in this country is done by
money alone, the Stock Exchange would soon buy up the House of
Commons, and if a single Jew were admitted, the whole would
shortly be a perfect Sanhedrim. This is a pleasant account of the
spirit of English patriotism, and the texture of the House of
Commons. All the wealth of the Jews cannot buy them a single seat
there; but if a certain formal restriction were taken off, Jewish gold
would buy up the fee simple of the consciences, prejudices and
interests of the country, and turn the kingdom <em>topsy-turvy</em>. Thus the
bed-rid imagination of prejudice sees some dreadful catastrophe in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>every improvement, and no longer feeling the ground of custom under
its feet, fancies itself on an abyss of ruin and lawless change. How
truly has it been said of prejudice, ‘that it has the singular ability of
accommodating itself to all the possible varieties of the human mind.
Some passions and vices are but thinly scattered among mankind, and
find only here and there a fitness of reception. But prejudice, like
the spider, makes every where its home. It has neither taste nor
choice of place, and all that it requires is room. There is scarcely a
situation, except fire and water, in which a spider will not live. So
let the mind be as naked as the walls of an empty and forsaken
tenement, gloomy as a dungeon, or ornamented with the richest
abilities of thinking; let it be hot, cold, dark or light, lonely or
inhabited, still prejudice, if undisturbed, will fill it with cobwebs, and
live like the spider, where there seems nothing to live on. If the
one prepares her food by poisoning it to her palate and her use, the
other does the same; and as several of our passions are strongly
characterised by the animal world, prejudice may be denominated the
spider of the mind.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Three hundred years ago all this was natural and in order, because
it accorded with the prejudices of the time; now it is absurd and
Gothic, because it is contrary to men’s reason and feelings. Hatred
is the food and growth of ignorance. While we know nothing but
ourselves and our own notions, we can conceive of nothing else as
possible; and every deviation from our practice or opinions gives a
shock to our faith that nothing can expiate but blows. Those who
differ from us in the smallest particular are considered as of a different
species, and we treat them accordingly. But this barrier of prejudice,
which is founded on ignorance, is thrown down by the diffusion of
light and knowledge; nor can any thing build it up again. In the
good old times a Jew was regarded by the vulgar and their betters as
a sort of monster, a <em>lusus naturæ</em> whose existence they could not
account for, and would not tolerate. The only way to get rid of the
obnoxious opinion was to destroy the <em>man</em>. Besides, in those dark
ages, they wanted some object of natural antipathy, as in country
places they get a strange dog or an idiot to hunt down and be the
bugbear of the village. But it is the test of reason and refinement to
be able to subsist without bugbears. While it was supposed that
‘the Jews eat little children,’ it was proper to take precautions
against them. But why keep up ill names and the ill odour of a prejudice
when the prejudice has ceased to exist? It has long ceased
amongst the reflecting part of the community; and, although the oldest
prejudices are, it is to be lamented, preserved longest in the highest
places, and governments have been slow to learn good manners, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>cannot but be conscious that these errors are passing away. We
begin to see, if we do not fully see, that we have no superiority to
boast of but reason and philosophy, and that it is well to get rid of
vulgar prejudices and nominal distinctions as fast as possible.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>ON THE PUNISHMENT OF DEATH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The view which has been taken of the subject by Beccaria and other
modern writers appears to be erroneous or defective in some of the
most important circumstances relating to this question.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>First objection.</em> It is assumed as a general maxim, that, ‘it is not
the intensity of punishment, but its duration, which makes the greatest
impression on the human mind.’</p>

<p class='c007'>This maxim will be found to be in direct opposition to all experience,
and to every principle of human nature. It supposes that a
number of impressions, feeble in themselves, and dissipated over a long
interval of time, produce a stronger effect upon the mind, than a single
object, however powerful and striking, presented to it at once: that
is, that the passions are excited more by reason than imagination,
by the real, than by the apparent quantity of good or evil. This
principle is indeed, in general, denied by Mr. Bentham, but admitted
by him, as far as relates to the influence of the fear of death on
malefactors. If it be true with respect to them in particular (which
there is reason to doubt,) it is not because the fear of a continued
punishment influences them more than the fear of an intense one, but
because death is to them not an intense punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, it has been said, that ‘crimes are more effectually prevented
by the certainty than by the severity of the punishment.’ Now I
cannot think that this is either self-evident, or true universally and in
the abstract. It is not true of human nature in general, and it is still
less so as applied to the more lawless and abandoned classes of the
community. It is evident from the very character of such persons,
that if they are not to be acted upon by violent motives, by what
appeals strongly to their imagination and their passions, they cannot
be acted upon at all, they are out of the reach of all moral discipline.
The dull, sober certainties of common life, and the real consequences of
things when set in competition with any favourite inclination, or vicious
indulgence, they altogether despise. It is only when the certainty
of punishment is immediate, obvious, and connected with circumstances,
which strike upon the imagination, that it operates effectually
in the prevention of crimes. This principle is however true, as it
has been sometimes applied to cases where the law has become a dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>letter. <em>When a moderate punishment is strictly and vigorously enforced,
and a severe punishment is as generally and systematically evaded, the
mind will, undoubtedly, be more affected by what it considers as a serious
reality, than by what it will regard as an idle threat.</em> So far the principle
is true in its application, but no farther.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>First maxim.</em> It is not the <em>real</em>, but the apparent severity of the
punishment which most effectually deters from the commission of
crimes. For this reason, an intense punishment will have more effect
than a continued one, because more easily apprehended. Neither is
the certainty of punishment to be depended on, except when it is
apparent. <em>It is not the calculation of consequences, but their involuntary
and irresistible impression on the mind that produces action. The laws
to prevent crimes must appeal to the passions of men, and not to their
reason: for crimes proceed from passion, and not from reason. If men
were governed by reason, laws would be unnecessary.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><em>Second objection.</em> It seems to be taken for granted by speculative
writers, (at least the contrary is not stated with sufficient distinctness)
that punishment operates by terror alone, or by the fear which each
individual has of the consequences to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is indeed a prevailing maxim of philosophy, that self-interest is
the sole spring of action, and it has thus probably been inferred, that
the fear of punishment could only operate on this principle of cool,
calculating self-interest. But it is quite certain that sympathy with
others, whatever may be its origin, is, practically speaking, an
independent and powerful principle of action. The opinions and
feelings of others do actually and constantly influence our conduct,
in opposition to our strongest interests and inclinations. That punishment,
therefore, will not be the most dreaded, nor, consequently, the
most effectual, which is the greatest to the individual, unless it is at
the same time thought so by others, and expresses the greatest general
disapprobation of the crime. Thus, though a malefactor, consulting
only his own inclinations or feelings, might prefer death to perpetual
imprisonment and hard labour, yet he may regard it as the worst of
punishments, in as far as it demonstrates the greatest abhorrence and
indignation in the community against the crime.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Second maxim.</em> Punishment operates by sympathy, as well as by
terror. Penal laws have a tendency to repress crimes not more by
exciting a dread of the consequences, than by marking the strong
sense entertained by others of their enormity, and the detestation in
which they are held by mankind in general. The most severe laws
will always be the most effectual, as long as they are expressions of
the public sentiment; but they will become ineffectual, in proportion
as the sentiment is wanting. The disproportion between the crime
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>and the punishment in the public opinion, will then counteract the
dread of the severity of the law. Setting this feeling aside, the most
severe laws will be the most effectual. The argument drawn from
the inefficacy of severe punishments, when inflicted on trifling or
common offences, does not prove that they must be ineffectual, when
applied to great crimes, which rouse the public indignation and justify
the severity.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Third objection.</em> It is farther implied in the foregoing statements,
that the only object of punishment is to prevent actual crimes, or that
those laws are the best, which most effectually answer this end by
deterring criminals.</p>

<p class='c007'>This I also conceive to be a narrow and imperfect view of the
question, which respects not merely the motives and conduct of
criminals, but the motives and sentiments of the community at large.
It is of the first importance that the ill disposed should be coerced,
but it is also of importance that they should be coerced in such a
manner, and by such means, as it is most consistent with the public
morals to employ. In defending the state, we are not to forget that
the state ought to be worth defending. As the sentiments of society
have a powerful effect in enforcing the laws, so the laws re-act powerfully
on the sentiments of society. This is evident with respect to
barbarous punishments. The evil of a law operating in this way on
manners, by holding out an example of cruelty and injustice, however
effectual it might be found, is not denied. In like manner, a law
falling short of or disappointing the just indignation and moral sense
of the community, is, for the same reason, faulty as one that exceeds
and outrages it. One end of punishment, therefore, is to satisfy this
natural sense of justice in the public mind, and to strengthen the
opinion of the community by its act. As the arm of justice ought
not to be mocked and baffled by the impunity of offences, so neither
ought it to be unnerved by thwarting and prevaricating with the common
sentiments of mankind, or by substituting remote, indirect, and
artificial punishments for obvious and direct ones. I call a punishment
natural when it is dictated by the <em>passion</em> excited against the
crime. A punishment will therefore be the most beneficial when it
arises out of, and co-operates with that strong sense of right or wrong,
that firm and healthy tone of public sentiment, which is the best
preservative against crime.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Illustration.</em> Thus even if it were shewn that perpetual imprisonment
and hard labour would be equally effectual in deterring
malefactors from the commission of murder, it would by no means
necessarily follow, that this mode of punishment would be preferable
to capital punishment, unless it could at the same time be made to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>appear that it would equally enforce the principle of the connexion
between the crime and the punishment, or the rule of natural justice,
by which he who shews himself indifferent to the life of another,
forfeits his own. There is a natural and home-felt connexion between
the hardened obduracy which has shewn itself insensible to the cries
of another for mercy and the immediate burst of indignation which
dooms the criminal to feel that he has no claims on the pity of
others: but there is no connexion, because there is no ascertainable
proportion, in the mind either of the criminal or the public, between
the original crime, and the additional half-hour in the day after the
lapse of twenty years, which the malefactor is condemned to labour,
or the lash of the whip which urges him to complete his heavy task.
That reasoning which stops the torrent of public indignation, and
diverts it from its object only to dole it out to its miserable victim,
drop by drop, and day by day, through a long protracted series of
time with systematic, deliberate, unrelenting severity, is in fact neither
wise nor humane. Punishments of this kind may be so contrived as
to intimidate the worst part of mankind, but they will also be the
aversion of the best, and will confound and warp the plain distinctions
between right and wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Third maxim.</em> The end of punishment is not only to prevent actual
crimes, but to form a standard of public opinion, and to confirm and
sanction the moral sentiments of the community. The mode and
degree of the punishment ought, therefore, to be determined with a
view to this object, as well as with a view to the regulation of the police.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Fourth objection.</em> The theory here alluded to, is farther objectionable
in this, that it makes familiarity with the punishment essential
to its efficacy, and therefore recommends those punishments, the
example of which is the most lasting, and, as it were, constantly
before the eyes of the public, as the most salutary. On the contrary,
those punishments are the best which require the least previous
familiarity with objects of guilt and misery to make them formidable,
which come least into contact with the mind, which tell at a distance,
the bare mention of which startles the ear, which operate by an
imaginary instead of an habitual dread, and which produce their
effect once for all, without destroying the erectness and elasticity of
social feeling by the constant spectacle of the degradation of the
species. No one would wish to have a gibbet placed before his
door, to deter his neighbours from robbing him. Punishments which
require repeated ocular inspection of the evils which they occasion,
cannot answer their end in deterring individuals, without having first
operated as a penance on society. They are a public benefit only so
far as they are a public nuisance. Laws framed entirely on this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>principle, would convert the world into a large prison, and divide
mankind into two classes, felons and their keepers!</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Maxim fourth.</em> Those punishments are the best which produce the
strongest apprehension, with the least actual suffering or contemplation
of evil. Such is in general the effect of those punishments which
appeal to the imagination, rather than to our physical experience;
which are immediately connected with a principle of honour, with the
passions in general, with natural antipathies, the fear of pain, the fear
of death, etc. These punishments are, in Mr. Bentham’s phrase, the
most <em>economical</em>; they do their work with the least expense of individual
suffering, or abuse of public sympathy. Private punishments
are, so far, preferable to public ones.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>General inference.</em> There ought to be a gradation of punishments
proportioned to the offence, and adapted to the state of society.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to strike the imagination and excite terror, severe punishments
ought not to be common.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c008'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To be effectual, from the sympathy of mankind in the justice of
the sentence, the highest punishments ought not to be assigned to the
lowest or to very different degrees of guilt. The absence of the
sanction of public opinion not only deadens the execution of the law,
but by giving confidence to the offender, produces that sort of resistance
to it, which is always made to oppression. The ignominy
attached to the sentence of the law, is thus converted into pity. If
the law is enacted but not enforced, this must either be to such a
degree as to take away the terror of the law, or if the terror still
remains, it will be a terror of injustice, which will necessarily impair
the sense of right and wrong in the community. But if the law is
regularly carried into execution, the effect will be still worse. In
general, all laws are bad which are not seconded by the manners of
the people, and laws are not in conformity with the manners of the
people when they are not executed. This is the case at present with
a great proportion of the English laws. Is it to be wondered at that
they should be so? Manners have changed, and will always change
insensibly, and irresistibly, from the force of circumstances. The
laws, as things of positive institution, remain the same. So that
without a constant, gradual assimilation of the laws to the manners,
the manners will, in time, necessarily become at variance with the
laws, and will render them odious, ineffectual, and mischievous—a
clog, instead of a furtherance to the wheels of justice.</p>

    conceivable that the editor of <cite>Literary Remains</cite> silently corrected an error 
    in the Magazine, but that does not seem likely, because, in the first place, the speech 
    seems more characteristic of Hunt than of Lamb, and, secondly, because the volume of the 
    <cite>New Monthly</cite> (<span class='fss'>XVI.</span>) in which the essay appeared 
    contains a list of errata in which two corrections (one of them relating to initials) are 
    made in the essay and yet this ‘H——’ is left uncorrected.

<h3 class='c018'>THE SICK CHAMBER</h3>

<p class='c017'>First republished in the volume of Selections edited by Mr. Ireland, who states,
apparently upon the evidence of dates and the nature of the subject, that this was
the last essay which Hazlitt wrote. This cannot be certainly known, and it
seems more likely that the essay on ‘Personal Politics’ (<em>post</em>, pp. 456–61) was
written later. The essay on ‘Footmen’ appeared in a later number of the <cite>New
Monthly</cite>. Hazlitt died on Sept. 18, 1830.</p>

    <dd>‘<span class='sc'>My dear Sir</span>,—I am sorry to be obliged, from want of health and a 
    number of other engagements, which I am little able to perform, to decline the flattering 
    offer you make me. I have got to write, between this and the end of October, an octavo 
    volume or a set of lectures on the Comic Drama of this country for the Surrey 
    Institution, which I am anxious not to slur over, and it will be as much as I can do to 
    get it ready in time. I am also afraid that I should not be able to do the article in 
    question, or yourself, justice, for I am not only without books, but without knowledge of 
    what books are necessary to be consulted on the subject. To get up an article in a Review 
    on any subject of general literature is quite as much as I can do without exposing 
    myself. The object of an Encyclopædia is, I take it, to condense and combine all the 
    facts relating to a subject, and all the theories of any consequence already known or 
    advanced. Now, where the business of such a work ends, is just where I begin, that is, I 
    might perhaps throw in an idle speculation or two of my own, not contained in former 
    accounts of the subject, and which would have very little pretensions to rank as 
    scientific. I know something about Congreve, but nothing at all of Aristophanes, and yet 
    I conceive that the writer of an article on the <cite>Drama</cite> ought to be as well 
    acquainted with the one as the other. If you should see Mr. Constable, will you tell him 
    I am writing <em>nonsense</em> for him as fast as I can?—Your very humble servant,

<h3 class='c018'>POETRY</h3>

<p class='c017'>Now republished for the first time. Some of the essays now first republished
from <cite>The Atlas</cite> are identified as Hazlitt’s in Mr. W. C. Hazlitt’s <cite>Memoirs</cite>, etc.
(see <span class='fss'>I.</span> xxix. and xxx.). The others have been included on the strength of the
internal evidence of authorship. A short paper, attributed to Hazlitt by Mr.
W. C. Hazlitt (<cite>Memoirs</cite>, <span class='fss'>I.</span> xxix.), and entitled ‘Richesse de la Langue,’ had
appeared in <cite>The Atlas</cite> for Jan. 25, 1829. It runs as follows:—</p>

<p class='c020'>‘How should one convey by a single word an expression of face which
having arisen from some strong passion, uneasiness or emotion, is converted
into an habitual character, and remains without any immediate object to
excite it? In the English language there are above thirty ways of doing
this, or else approaching to, and hovering round the point. As for
instance, we may express this look by the following epithets, more or less
pointedly, and with various inflections of meaning attached to them:—<em>wild</em>,
<em>scared</em>, <em>startled</em>, <em>haggard</em>, <em>harassed</em>, <em>hunted</em>, <em>nervous</em>, <em>agitated</em>, <em>apprehensive</em>,
<em>terrified</em>, <em>dismayed</em>, <em>abstracted</em>, <em>stunned</em>, <em>panick-struck</em>, <em>odd</em>, <em>strange</em>, <em>wayward</em>,
<em>flighty</em>, <em>uncouth</em>, <em>unaccountable</em>, <em>eccentric</em>, <em>embarrassed</em>, <em>unsettled</em>, <em>uneasy</em>, <em>overconscious</em>,

word in the English language, and that it might be suggested by some one
who has a greater command of its resources. The above remarks may
serve to guard the student of English, whether a foreigner or merely a
stranger to his native tongue, against unmeaning <em>synonymes</em> or monotonous
common-place.’</p>

<h3 class='c018'>EMANCIPATION OF THE JEWS</h3>

<p class='c017'>This paper was printed in Leigh Hunt’s <cite>The Tatler</cite> for March, 1831 (vol. <span class='fss'>II.</span>),
and also, separately, in pamphlet form. Mr. Bertram Dobell kindly showed to
the Editors a copy of this pamphlet in his possession which bore the following
(anonymous) marginal note: ‘Written by Hazlitt, and a little altered by Mr.
Basil Montagu—Mr. Isaac Goldsmid caused this little tract to be written, and
defrayed all the expenses of authorship, printing, etc. It was the last production,
I think, of Hazlitt’s pen.’ From a proof in the Editors’ possession it is clear that
the essay was sent by Hazlitt’s son to <cite>The Daily News</cite> and set up in type in
1849, but it seems never to have been published by that journal. The essay is
here reprinted from the pamphlet. <cite>The Tatler</cite> and <cite>The Daily News</cite> proof show
only trifling typographical variations. It will be remembered that Macaulay’s
maiden speech (April 5, 1830) was in favour of a bill for the removal of Jewish
disabilities. The emancipation of the Jews was not effected till 1858.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>ON THE PUNISHMENT OF DEATH</h3>

<p class='c017'><cite>Fraser’s Magazine</cite> for January 1831 contains an article on Capital Punishment
in which the author introduces an extract from an essay by Hazlitt on the same
subject. The extract is thus introduced: ‘It forms part of an essay which was
written a few years ago by the late W. Hazlitt, at the request of a society then
existing in London for obtaining a repeal of that formidable law, and seems to
contain pretty much the sum of what might be brought forward against that
punishment by a philosophical reasoner. It has never yet been published.’

<p class='c007'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. ‘The gentle and free passage of arms at Ashby’ was, we are told, so called by
the Chroniclers of the time, on account of the feats of horsemanship and the
quantity of knightly blood that was shed. This last circumstance was perhaps
necessary to qualify it with the epithet of ‘gentle,’ in the opinion of some of these
historians. I think the reason why the English are the bravest nation on earth is,
that the thought of blood or a delight in cruelty is not the chief excitement with
them. Where it is, there is necessarily a <em>reaction</em>; for though it may add to our
eagerness and savage ferocity in inflicting wounds, it does not enable us to endure
them with greater patience. The English are led to the attack or sustain it equally
well, because they fight as they box, not out of malice, but to show pluck and manhood.
<em>Fair play and old England for ever!</em> This is the only bravery that will
stand the test. There is the same determination and spirit shown in resistance as
in attack; but not the same pleasure in getting a cut with a sabre as in giving one.
There is, therefore, always a certain degree of effeminacy mixed up with any
approach to cruelty, since both have their source in the same principle, <em>viz.</em> an
over-valuing of pain.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c008'><sup>[67]</sup></a> This was the reason the French (having the best cause
and the best general in the world) ran away at Waterloo, because they were
inflamed, furious, drunk with the blood of their enemies, but when it came to
their turn, wanting the same stimulus, they were panic-struck, and their hearts
and their senses failed them all at once.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. Bells are peculiar to England. They jingle them in Italy during the carnival
as boys do with us at Shrovetide; but they have no notion of ringing them. The
sound of village bells never cheers you in travelling, nor have you the lute or
cittern in their stead. The expression of ‘Merry Bells’ is a favourite and not one
of the least appropriate in our language.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. Lord Bacon is not included in this list, nor do I know where he should come
in. It is not easy to make room for him and his reputation together. This great
and celebrated man in some of his works recommends it to pour a bottle of claret
into the ground of a morning, and to stand over it, inhaling the perfumes. So he
sometimes enriched the dry and barren soil of speculation with the fine aromatic
spirit of his genius. His ‘Essays’ and his ‘Advancement of Learning’ are works
of vast depth and scope of observation. The last, though it contains no positive
discoveries, is a noble chart of the human intellect, and a guide to all future
inquirers.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. As when a person asks you ‘whether you do not find a strong resemblance
between Rubens’s pictures and Quarles’s poetry?’—which is owing to the critic’s
having lately been at Antwerp and bought an edition of Quarles’s Emblems. Odd
combinations must take place where a number of ideas are brought together, with
only a thin, hasty partition between them, and without a sufficient quantity of
judgment to discriminate. An Englishman, of some apparent consequence passing
by the St. Peter Martyr of Titian at Venice, observed ‘It was a copy of the same
subject by Domenichino at Bologna.’ This betrayed an absolute ignorance both
of Titian and of Domenichino, and of the whole world of art: yet unless I had also
seen the St. Peter at Bologna, this connoisseur would have had the advantage of
me, two to one, and might have disputed the precedence of the two pictures with
me, but that chronology would have come to my aid. Thus persons who travel
from place to place, and roam from subject to subject, make up by the extent and
discursiveness of their knowledge for the want of truth and refinement in their
conception of the objects of it.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. There are few things more contemptible than the conversation of mere <em>men of
the town</em>. It is made up of the technicalities and cant of all professions, without
the spirit or knowledge of any. It is flashy and vapid, or is like the rinsings of
different liquors at a night-cellar instead of a bottle of fine old port. It is without
body or clearness, and a heap of affectation. In fact, I am very much of the
opinion of that old Scotch gentleman who owned that ‘he preferred the dullest
book he had ever read to the most brilliant conversation it had ever fallen to his
lot to hear!’</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. Mr. Bentham proposes to new-model the penal code, on the principle of a
cool and systematic calculation of consequences. Yet of all philosophers, the
candidates for Panopticons and Penitentiaries are the most short-sighted and
refractory. Punishment has scarcely any effect upon them. Thieves steal under
the scaffold; and if a person’s previous feelings and habits do not prevent his
running the risk of the gallows, assuredly the fear of consequences, or his having
already escaped it, with all the good resolutions he may have made on the occasion,
will not prevent his exposing himself to it a second time. It is true, most
people have a natural aversion to being hanged. The perseverance of culprits in
their evil courses seems a fatality, which is strengthened by the prospect of what
is to follow. Mr. Bentham argues that all ‘men act from calculation, even madmen
reason.’ So far it may be true that the world is not unlike a great Bedlam,
or answers to the title of an old play—‘A Mad World, my masters!’ This is our
world, but not his. Life, on looking back to it, too often resembles a disturbed
dream, which does not infer its having been guided by reason in its progress.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. [‘Have I not seen a household where love was not?’ says the author of the

criminal?’—‘I would take the <em>Ghost’s</em> word for a thousand pound,’ or in preference
to that of any man living, though I was told in the streets of Edinburgh, that
Dr. Jamieson, the author of the ‘Dictionary,’ was quite as great a man!]</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. The thoughts of a captive can no more get beyond his prison-walls than his
limbs, unless they are busied in planning an escape; as, on the contrary, what
prisoner, after effecting his escape, ever suffered them to return there, or took
common precautions to prevent his own? We indulge our fancy more than we
consult our interest. The sense of personal identity has almost as little influence
in practice as it has foundation in theory.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. Taylor, of the Opera-House, used to say of Sheridan, that he could not pull off
his hat to him in the street without its costing him fifty pounds; and if he stopped
to speak to him, it was a hundred. No one could be a stronger instance than he
was of what is called <em>living from hand to mouth</em>. He was always in want of money,
though he received vast sums which he must have disbursed; and yet nobody can
tell what became of them, for he paid nobody. He spent his wife’s fortune
(sixteen hundred pounds) in a six weeks’ jaunt to Bath, and returned to town as
poor as a rat. Whenever he and his son were invited out into the country, they
always went in two post-chaises and four; he in one, and his son Tom following
in another. This is the secret of those who live in a round of extravagance, and
are at the same time always in debt and difficulty—they throw away all the
ready money they get upon any newfangled whim or project that comes in their
way, and never think of paying off old scores, which of course accumulate to a
dreadful amount. ‘Such gain the cap of him who makes them fine, yet keeps his
book uncrossed.’ Sheridan once wanted to take Mrs. Sheridan a very handsome
dress down into the country, and went to Barber and Nunn’s to order it, saying he
must have it by such a day, but promising they should have ready money.
Mrs. Barber (I think it was) made answer that the time was short, but that ready
money was a very charming thing, and that he should have it. Accordingly, at
the time appointed she brought the dress, which came to five-and-twenty pounds,
and it was sent in to Mr. Sheridan: who sent out a Mr. Grimm (one of his
jackalls) to say he admired it exceedingly, and that he was sure Mrs. Sheridan
would be delighted with it, but he was sorry to have nothing under a hundred
pound bank-note in the house. She said she had come provided for such an
accident, and could give change for a hundred, two hundred, or five hundred pound
note, if it were necessary. Grimm then went back to his principal for farther
instructions: who made an excuse that he had no stamped receipt by him. For
this, Mrs. B. said, she was also provided; she had brought one in her pocket. At
each message, she could hear them laughing heartily in the next room at the idea
of having met with their match for once; and presently after, Sheridan came out
in high good-humour, and paid her the amount of her bill, in ten, five, and
one pounds. Once when a creditor brought him a bill for payment, which had
often been presented before, and the man complained of its soiled and tattered
state, and said he was quite ashamed to see it, ‘I’ll tell you what I’d advise you to
do with it, my friend,’ said Sheridan, ‘take it home, and write it upon <em>parchment</em>!’
He once mounted a horse which a horse-dealer was shewing off near a coffee-house
at the bottom of St. James’s-street, rode it to Tattersall’s, and sold it, and
walked quietly back to the spot from which he set out. The owner was furious,
swore he would be the death of him; and, in quarter of an hour afterwards they
were seen sitting together over a bottle of wine in the coffee-house, the horse-jockey
with the tears running down his face at Sheridan’s jokes, and almost ready
to hug him as an honest fellow. Sheridan’s house and lobby were beset with duns
every morning, who were told that Mr. Sheridan was not yet up, and shewn into
the several rooms on each side of the entrance. As soon as he had breakfasted,
he asked, ‘Are those doors all shut, John?’ and, being assured they were, marched
out very deliberately between them, to the astonishment of his self-invited guests,
who soon found the bird was flown. I have heard one of his old City friends
declare, that such was the effect of his frank, cordial manner, and insinuating
eloquence, that he was always afraid to go to ask him for a debt of long standing,
lest he should borrow twice as much. A play had been put off one night, or a
favourite actor did not appear, and the audience demanded to have their money
back again: but when they came to the door, they were told by the check-takers
there was none for them, for that Mr. Sheridan had been in the mean time, and
had carried off all the money in the till. He used often to get the old cobbler who
kept a stall under the ruins of Drury Lane to broil a beef-steak for him, and take
their dinner together. On the night that Drury Lane was burnt down, Sheridan
was in the House of Commons, making a speech, though he could hardly stand
without leaning his hands on the table, and it was with some difficulty he was
forced away, urging the plea, ‘What signified the concerns of a private individual,
compared to the good of the state?’ When he got to Covent Garden, he went
into the Piazza Coffee-house, to steady himself with another bottle, and then
strolled out to the end of the Piazza to look at the progress of the fire. Here he
was accosted by Charles Kemble and Fawcett, who complimented him on the
calmness with which he seemed to regard so great a loss. He declined this praise,
and said—‘Gentlemen, there are but three things in human life that in my opinion
ought to disturb a wise man’s patience. The first of these is bodily pain, and that
(whatever the ancient stoics may have said to the contrary) is too much for any
man to bear without flinching: this I have felt severely, and I know it to be the
case. The second is the loss of a friend whom you have dearly loved; that,
gentlemen, is a great evil: this I have also felt, and I know it to be too much
for any man’s fortitude. And the third is the consciousness of having done an unjust
action. That, gentlemen, is a great evil, a very great evil, too much for any man to
endure the reflection of; but that’ (laying his hand upon his heart,) ‘but that, thank
God, I have never felt!’ I have been told that these were nearly the very
words, except that he appealed to the <em>mens conscia recti</em> very emphatically three or
four times over, by an excellent authority, Mr. Mathews the player, who was on
the spot at the time, a gentleman whom the public admire deservedly, but with
whose real talents and nice discrimination of character his friends only are
acquainted. Sheridan’s reply to the watchman who had picked him up in the
street, and who wanted to know who he was, ‘I am Mr. Wilberforce!’—is well
known, and shews that, however frequently he might be at a loss for money, he
never wanted wit!</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. Lady Wortley Montague says, in one of her letters, that ‘she would much
rather be a rich <em>effendi</em>, with all his ignorance, than Sir Isaac Newton, with all his
knowledge.’ This was not perhaps an impolitic choice, as she had a better chance
of becoming one than the other, there being many rich effendis to one Sir Isaac
Newton. The wish was not a very intellectual one. The same petulance of rank
and sex breaks out every where in these “<cite>Letters</cite>.” She is constantly reducing
the poets or philosophers who have the misfortune of her acquaintance, to the
figure they might make at her Ladyship’s levee or toilette, not considering that
the public mind does not sympathize with this process of a fastidious imagination.
In the same spirit, she declares of Pope and Swift, that ‘had it not been for the
<em>good-nature</em> of mankind, these two superior beings were entitled, by their birth
and hereditary fortune, to be only a couple of link-boys.’ Gulliver’s Travels, and
the Rape of the Lock, go for nothing in this critical estimate, and the world
raised the authors to the rank of superior beings, in spite of their disadvantages of
birth and fortune, <em>out of pure good-nature</em>! So, again, she says of Richardson, that
he had never got beyond the servants’ hall, and was utterly unfit to describe the
manners of people of quality; till in the capricious workings of her vanity, she
persuades herself that Clarissa is very like what she was at her age, and that Sir
Thomas and Lady Grandison strongly resembled what she had heard of her
mother and remembered of her father. It is one of the beauties and advantages
of literature, that it is the means of abstracting the mind from the narrowness
of local and personal prejudices, and of enabling us to judge of truth and excellence
by their inherent merits alone. Woe be to the pen that would undo this fine
illusion (the only reality), and teach us to regulate our notions of genius and virtue
by the circumstances in which they happen to be placed! You would not expect
a person whom you saw in a servants’ hall, or behind a counter, to write Clarissa;
but after he had written the work, to <em>prejudge</em> it from the situation of the writer,
is an unpardonable piece of injustice and folly. His merit could only be the
greater from the contrast. If literature is an elegant accomplishment, which none
but persons of birth and fashion should be allowed to excel in, or to exercise with
advantage to the public, let them by all means take upon them the task of
enlightening and refining mankind: if they decline this responsibility as too heavy
for their shoulders, let those who do the drudgery in their stead, however inadequately,
for want of their polite example, receive the meed that is their due, and
not be treated as low pretenders who have encroached on the province of their
betters. Suppose Richardson to have been acquainted with the great man’s steward,
or valet, instead of the great man himself, I will venture to say that there was
more difference between him who lived in an <em>ideal world</em>, and had the genius and
felicity to open that world to others, and his friend the steward, than between the
lacquey and the mere lord, or between those who lived in different rooms of the
same house, who dined on the same luxuries at different tables, who rode outside
or inside of the same coach, and were proud of wearing or of bestowing the same
tawdry livery. If the lord is distinguished from his valet by any thing else, it is
by education and talent, which he has in common with our author. But if the
latter shews these in the highest degree, it is asked what are his pretensions?
Not birth or fortune, for neither of these would enable him to write a Clarissa.
One man is born with a title and estate, another with genius. That is sufficient;
and we have no right to question the genius for want of the <em>gentility</em>, unless the
former ran in families, or could be bequeathed with a fortune, which is not the
case. Were it so, the flowers of literature, like jewels and embroidery, would be
confined to the fashionable circles; and there would be no pretenders to taste or
elegance but those whose names were found in the court list. No one objects to
Claude’s Landscapes as the work of a pastrycook, or withholds from Raphael the
epithet of <em>divine</em>, because his parents were not rich. This impertinence is confined
to men of letters; the evidence of the senses baffles the envy and foppery of mankind.
No quarter ought to be given to this <em>aristocratic</em> tone of criticism whenever
it appears. People of quality are not contented with carrying all the external
advantages for their own share, but would persuade you that all the intellectual
ones are packed up in the same bundle. Lord Byron was a later instance of this
double and unwarrantable style of pretension—<em>monstrum ingens, biforme</em>. He could
not endure a lord who was not a wit, nor a poet who was not a lord. Nobody
but himself answered to his own standard of perfection. Mr. Moore carries a
proxy in his pocket from some noble persons to estimate literary merit by the
same rule. Lady Mary calls Fielding names, but she afterwards makes atonement
by doing justice to his frank, free, hearty nature, where she says ‘his spirits gave
him raptures with his cook-maid, and cheerfulness when he was starving in a
garret, and his happy constitution made him forget every thing when he was placed
before a venison pasty or over a flask of champagne.’ She does not want
shrewdness and spirit when her petulance and conceit do not get the better of her,
and she has done ample and merited execution on Lord Bolingbroke. She is,
however, very angry at the freedoms taken with the Great; <em>smells a rat</em> in this
indiscriminate scribbling, and the familiarity of writers with the reading public;
and inspired by her Turkish costume, foretells a French or English revolution as
the consequence of transferring the patronage of letters from the <em>quality</em> to the
mob, and of supposing that ordinary writers or readers can have any notions in
common with their superiors.</p>

a person in our time believing in the heathen mythology. He had a very beautiful
wife. An impudent Frenchman, who came over to London, and lodged in the
same house, made love to her, by pretending to worship her as Venus, and so
thought to turn the tables on our philosopher. I once spent an evening with this
gentleman at Mr. G. D.’s chambers, in Clifford’s inn, (where there was no exclusion
of persons or opinions), and where we had pipes and tobacco, porter, and bread
and cheese for supper. Mr. Taylor never smoked, never drank porter, and had an
aversion to cheese. I remember he shewed with some triumph two of his fingers,
which had been bent so that he had lost the use of them, in copying out the manuscripts
of Proclus and Plotinus in a fine Greek hand. Such are the trophies of
human pride! It would be well if our deep studies often produced no other
crookedness and deformity! I endeavoured (but in vain) to learn something from the
heathen philosopher as to Plato’s doctrine of abstract ideas being the foundation of
particular ones, which I suspect has more truth in it than we moderns are willing
to admit. Another friend of mine once breakfasted with Mr. D. (the most
amiable and absent of hosts), when there was no butter, no knife to cut the loaf
with, and the tea-pot was without a spout. My friend after a few immaterial
ceremonies, adjourned to Peel’s coffee-house, close by, where he regaled himself on
buttered toast, coffee, and the newspaper of the day (a newspaper possessed some
interest when we were young); and the only interruption to his satisfaction was the
fear that his host might suddenly enter, and be shocked at his imperfect hospitality.
He would probably forget the circumstance altogether. I am afraid this veteran
of the old school has not received many proofs of the <em>archaism</em> of the prevailing
taste; and that the corrections in his History of the University of Cambridge, have
cost him more than the public will ever repay him for.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r37'>37</a>. An old friend of mine, when he read the abuse and billingsgate poured out in
certain Tory publications, used to congratulate himself upon it as a favourable sign
of the times, and of the progressive improvement of our manners. Where we now
called names, we formerly burnt each other at a stake; and all the malice of the
heart flew to the tongue and vented itself in scolding, instead of crusades and <em>auto-da-fés</em>—the
nobler revenge of our ancestors for a difference of opinion. An author
now libels a prince; and, if he takes the law of him or throws him into gaol, it
is looked upon as a harsh and ungentlemanly proceeding. He, therefore, gets a
dirty Secretary to employ a dirty bookseller, to hire a set of dirty scribblers, to pelt
him with dirt and cover him with blackguard epithets—till he is hardly in a condition
to walk the streets. This is hard measure, no doubt, and base ingratitude
on the part of the public, according to the imaginary dignity and natural precedence
which authors take of kings; but the latter are men, and will have their revenge
where they can get it. They have no longer their old summary appeal—their will
may still be good—to the dungeon and the dagger. Those who ‘speak evil
of dignities’ may, therefore, think themselves well off in being merely <em>sent to
Coventry</em>; and, besides, if they have <em>pluck</em>, they can make a Parthian retreat, and
shoot poisoned arrows behind them. The good people of Florence lift up their
hands when they are shewn the caricatures in the Queen’s Matrimonial-Ladder,
and ask if they are really a likeness of the King?</p>

easiness of address, which is so great a recommendation to most women.’ Is then
indifference or coldness the surest passport to the female heart? A man who is
much in love has not his wits properly about him: he can think only of her whose
image is engraven on his heart; he can talk only of her; he can only repeat the
same vows, and protestations, and expressions of rapture or despair. He may, by
this means, become importunate and troublesome—but does he deserve to lose his
mistress for the only cause that gives him a title to her—the sincerity of his
passion? We may perhaps answer this question by another—Is a woman to accept
of a madman, merely because he happens to fall in love with her? ‘The lunatic,
the lover and the poet,’ as Shakspeare has said, ‘are of imagination all compact,’
and must, in most cases, be contented with imagination as their reward. Realities
are out of their reach, as well as beneath their notice.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r40'>40</a>. Zoffani, a foreign artist, but who, by long residence in England, had got our
habits of indolence and dilatoriness, was employed by the late King, who was fond
of low comedy, to paint a scene for Reynolds’s <cite>Speculation</cite>; in which Quick,
Munden, and Miss Wallis were introduced. The King called to see it in its
progress; and at last it was done—‘<em>all but the coat</em>.’ The picture, however, was
not sent and the King repeated his visit to the artist. Zoffani with some
embarrassment said, ‘It was done all but the <em>goat</em>‘—‘Don’t tell me,’ said the impatient
monarch; ‘this is always the way: you said it was done all but the coat
the last time I was here.’—‘I said the <em>goat</em>, and please your Majesty.’—‘Aye’
replied the King, ‘the <em>goat</em> or the <em>coat</em>, I care not which you call it; I say I will
not have the picture,’—and was going to leave the room, when Zoffani, in an
agony, repeated, ‘It is the <em>goat</em> that is not finished,’—pointing to a picture of a
goat that was hung up in a frame as an ornament to the scene at the theatre. The
King laughed heartily at the blunder, and waited patiently till the goat was finished.
Zoffani, like other idle people, was careless and extravagant. He made a fortune
when he first came over here, which he soon spent: he then went out to India,
where he made another, with which he returned to England, and spent also. He
was an excellent theatrical portrait-painter, and has left delineations of celebrated
actors and interesting situations, which revive the dead, and bring the scene before us.</p>

Extraordinary talents are not once looked for. Nay, a person, who would never
have risen by natural abilities to the situation of churchwarden or parish beadle,
succeeds by unquestionable right to the possession of a throne, and wields the

soon after came on, and Mr. Croker, who is a dabbler in dirt, and an adept in
love-letters, rose from the affair Secretary to the Admiralty, and the very ‘rose
and expectancy of the fair State.’</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r54'>54</a>. The only friends whom we defend with zeal and obstinacy are our relations.
They seem part of ourselves. We cannot shake them off till they are hanged, nor
then neither! For our other friends we are only answerable, as long as we countenance
them; and we therefore cut the connection as soon as possible. But who ever
willingly gave up the good dispositions of a child, or the honour of a parent?</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r56'>56</a>. This was necessary in Latin, where no order was observed in the words of a
sentence: in English the juxtaposition generally determines the connection.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r58'>58</a>. An identical proposition is not an inference; but all reasoning consists in
inference, or in finding out one thing as implied in another. In comparing any
two objects, I have nothing previously given and cannot predict the result; but
having made the comparison, I have then something determined and fixed to go
by; and what else I discover or imagine must be in conformity with this first
knowledge. This coherence in propositions, or in the mind, is the force of <em>reason</em>,
whereby one idea acts as the ground-work or cause of another. If I apply B as a
common measure to A and C, and find it the same with both, it follows that they
are equal to one another; since otherwise I must suppose the same thing (B) to
be equal to unequal things, which is impossible as long as I retain my senses, or
more properly, my recollection. I have ascertained two lines to be of the length
of a third; that length cannot differ from itself; and therefore having settled
what the two lines are with respect to the third, I cannot conceive them to be
different with respect to one another, without forgetting myself, or what I know
of them. If I had no power of contemplating different propositions together, I
could draw no such conclusion; the conclusion therefore results from this comprehensive
power of the mind; and reason is the end or band that ties the bundle
of our separate ideas, or the logical <em>fasciculus</em> together.</p>

do not perceive the difference between the serious and the burlesque.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f60'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r60'>60</a>. Berkeley, in his <cite>Minute Philosopher</cite>, attacks Dr. Halley, who had objected to
faith and mysteries in religion, on this score; and contends that the mathematician,
no less than the theologian, is obliged to presume on certain <em>postulates</em>, or to resort,
before he could establish a single theorem, to a formal definition of those undefinable
and hypothetical existences, points, lines, and surfaces; and, according to the
ingenious and learned Bishop of Cloyne, <em>solids</em> would fare no better than <em>superficials</em>
in this war of words and captious contradiction.</p>

doing so.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f62'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r62'>62</a>. The common trick of making an imitation of the human countenance with a
napkin or the ends of the knuckles comes under the head of wit, not humour.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r64'>64</a>. Some one compared B——, a tall, awkward country lout to Adam, who came
into the world full grown, but without having ever made any use of his limbs.
This was wit, though true; where then is the ingredient of incongruity? In
altering the idea of Adam at pleasure, or from a mere possibility to make it answer
a ludicrous purpose. Adam is generally supposed an active, graceful person: a lad
grown up with large bones and muscles, with no more use of them than an infant,
is a laughable subject, because it deranges or unhinges our customary associations.
The threads of our ideas (so to speak) are strong and tightened by habit and will,
just as we tighten the strings of a fiddle with pegs and screws; and when any
of these are relaxed, snapped asunder, or unstrung by accident or folly, it is in
taking up the odds and ends (like stitches let down) as they hang light and loose,
and twisting them into some motley, ill-assorted pattern, so as to present a fantastic
and glaring contrast to custom (which is plain sense) or the <em>ideal</em>, which strengthens
and harmonizes (and which is poetry)—that the web of wit and humour consists.
The <em>serious</em> is that which is closely cemented together by experience and prejudice,
or by common sense: the ludicrous is the incoherent, or that which wants the
cement of habit and purpose; and wit is employed in finding out new and opposite
combinations of these detached and broken fragments (or exceptions to established
rules) so as to set off the distinction between absurdity and propriety in the most
lively and marked manner possible. Proof is not wanted here; illustration is
enough, and the more extravagant the better; for the cause being previously
condemned in our prosing judgments, we do not stand upon punctilio, but only
wait for a smart, sly excuse to get rid of it; and hence <em>tricking is fair in wit</em>, as
well as in war: where the justice of the cause is not the question, you have only to
fight it out or make the best of the case you can.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r65'>65</a>. Even then I should not despair. The Revolution of the Three Days was
like a resurrection from the dead, and showed plainly that liberty too has a spirit of
life in it; and that the hatred of oppression is ‘the unquenchable flame, the worm
that dies not.’</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r67'>67</a>. Vanity is the same half-witted principle, compared with pride. It leaves
men in the lurch when it is most needed; is mortified at being reduced to stand
on the defensive, and relinquishes the field to its more surly antagonist.</p>
